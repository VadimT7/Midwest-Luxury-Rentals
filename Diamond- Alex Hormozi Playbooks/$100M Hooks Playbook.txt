Hooks That Get Clicks

“After you’ve written your headline, you’ve spent eighty cents of your advertising dollar.” 
— David Ogilvy

Dean Graziosi told me this story over the kitchen table. And it forever changed how 
I viewed advertising, and specifically…hooks. Rather than second hand this story - I tran-
scribed an audio message Dean told me.

*In Dean’s Own Words*
Decades ago I used to watch Larry King. He interviewed people for 60+ years. Every presi-

dent. Michael Jackson. Madonna. And anyone you could think of. So 20 years ago I’m watching 
him interview Author Joel Olsteen… Joel is there presenting his new book. I thought to myself, 
how hard would it be for someone to buy his book after watching this interview? 

They have to write down the name of the book. Then get in the car and drive to the book-
store, assuming they didn’t forget about it by then. I thought, ‘imagine if there was a website and 
phone number at the bottom of the screen where people could get the book.’ And my new book was 
coming out in a few months. And so I thought how cool would it be to have a Larry King style 
interview, a Larry King style set, a big Larry King style microphone, Larry King style questions. 
The whole thing. 

I spent a ton trying to recreate it. And we recorded ‘that style’ and it broke all kinds of records. 
So it worked great. 

Then, about 10 years later, someone introduces me to Larry King. We hit it off, and I started 
telling him about the Joel Olsteen episode. And he goes to me ‘Why don’t we record one together?’ 
And I was like “Oh my God. That would be amazing.” 

So I pulled all the stuff out of storage from when I tried to make it look like his set, except 
this time it was Larry King doing the actual interview asking questions he thought of, not ones I 
made. 

So 10 days later we sit down to record the show. I get Larry King to interview me about my 
new book. So we were going to run the show in an infomercial interview style. And before I sit 
down, I watch every interview to be prepared for this. This was a huge deal for me! I wanted 
to get the opening just right. So I opened up the show exactly like he had been doing for years. I 
wrote this out. This was the hook I wrote. “Tonight on Larry King, I’m here with my guest Dean 
Graziosi he’s a multi New York Time best seller, a multi-millionaire, and tonight he’s gonna show

you how you can have that success too and talk about his book.” Then we went into this amazing 
interview. I know I knocked it out of the park.

Then, I ran the show as an ad exactly as I had successfully in the past when I tried to copy his 
style of interview. Except this time, when it was him, the real deal…the ad bombed! I was dev-
astated. I’d put so much into making this happen. And it didn’t even work. I tried a few more tv 
channels, and a few more stations, but it didn’t work. 

So I keep rewatching the show to try and figure out why it wasn’t working. I mean - this was 
Larry King for god’s sake and I had been doing infomercials for years. I thought to myself ‘Why 
isn’t this working?’ So I looked and I looked. Then…it hit me…THE HOOK. The opening sen-
tence. ‘They don’t care.’ And I was so excited to get interviewed by Larry King that I let my ego get 
ahead of me. I wanted him to introduce me like all his other big important guests. To make me 
feel important. But, it needed to make them feel important. 

So I pulled everything out of storage. I set up the entire studio again. Get a film crew out there. 
Pay to fly Larry back in. And all we did was have him re-record the opening sentence…the hook. 
And the new hook went something like this…the camera comes on and it pans to Larry King:

 “Have you ever in your adult life looked at yourself in the mirror and thought ‘I should be 
further ahead by now.?’ If you have, you’re not alone. And tonight, my guest Dean Graziosi is go-
ing to help you see how you can live to your full potential.”

And here’s the thing, only one or two sentences changed. The name of the book didn’t change. 
The cover didn’t change. The number of pages didn’t change. The offer didn’t change. The price 
didn’t change. The website to buy the book didn’t change. 

You know what did change - Just the opening sentences, the hook. 
Then that infomercial became a monster. It went on to sell millions of books and changed my 

life forever. 
This infomercial taught me the most valuable lesson in marketing. Since then, I’ve spent as 

much thinking about the first sentence as everything else combined. So whether it’s an email or 
a post or an ad or a webinar or a training– I obsess about the hook. I spend weeks dialing in the 
first few sentences to convince them to consume the rest of what I’ve got. It frames everything else 
and determines whether what you made is going to be a monster hit, or bomb. You gotta nail the 
hook or nothing else matters. 

***
When I heard this story, I doubled down on how much I obsess about ‘the hook.’ And 

if you want to grow your business, you should too.

$100M PLAYBOOK: HOOKS THAT GET CLICKS

What’s A Hook?

A hook is whatever gets the attention of your audience. All content, ads, and outreach, 
have hooks. It’s whatever people see and/or hear first. Think the first few seconds of a video, 
or the first thing you hear, or the first line or image your eyes see.

Good hooks get people to notice you and pay attention. Bad hooks people never notice. 
In other words, a good hook makes a sale. It sells the person on paying attention. We want 
them to think “Oh, this is for me.”

I try to make hooks specific enough to get the right people and broad enough to get as 
many of them as I can. So pay close attention to how advertisers use hooks, especially the 
ones targeting your audience.

What Makes Hooks So Important?

If nobody notices your ad, then nobody buys your stuff. Nothing else matters. Your en-
tire business hinges on these first few seconds. And yet, the vast majority of business owners 
ignore them!

Here’s the crazy part. If you know how to write good hooks, you can easily 5x, 10x, and 
sometimes 100x the amount of people that pay attention to your ads, content, or outreach 
attempts. Which means - yes - simply by mastering writing good hooks, you could 5x, 10x, 
or 100x your business. You could change nothing else and immediately get that many more 
leads for the same effort. This is how valuable this skill is. I am not overstating this. 

The longer I have been advertising, the less I care about anything else. If you have ten 
hours to advertise, focus your first eight hours on the hooks. That’s how important they are.

You might nod your head and think “How can I spend hours on something that only 
lasts a few seconds?” You just have to know how. And that’s what I’m gonna show you. 

How Do Hooks Work?

Hooks have two key parts. First, you have some sort of call out. This gets the prospect 
to say, ‘This is for me.’ This happens verbally and nonverbally. Second, you have some sort 
of condition for value. This is the hook itself. 

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 3



$100M PLAYBOOK: HOOKS THAT GET CLICKS

The first part - the call out - grabs attention in order to deliver that promise. This is the 
easiest analogy I can think of for it…

Imagine you’re at a club. Lots of people are hooting and hollering. Loud music thump-
ing. In all that noise, a single sound pierces through it all and you turn around. Wanna 
know the sound? Your name. You hear it, and instantly look for the source. 

Scientists call it the ‘cocktail party effect.’ In simple terms, even when there’s tons of 
stuff going on, a single thing can still catch and hold our attention. So our goal with our call 
outs is to harness the cocktail party effect and cut through all the noise.

The second part - the hook - promises some sort of value. If you consume this thing, you 
will get value. If you - the target, do this thing, you will get this value. Sometimes that condi-
tion is explicit - you literally say “If [MOMS - target] [WATCH THIS VIDEO - condition] 
[THEY WILL KNOW HOW TO GET THEIR KIDS TO BEHAVE - reward/value].” 

Sometimes the promise is implicit. Think of a mom showing a kid behaving well in the 
midst of chaos. Then she turns to the camera and says, ‘Look how I did it.’ Communication 
has way more factors than I pretend to understand - but the bottom line is - they consume 
if they think the cost of consuming is less than the benefit they get from it. And the hook sets 
up those conditions.

Types Of Hooks: Verbal And Nonverbal

In the broadest sense, anything that gets someone to notice your ad is a hook. So, I’ll 
break hooks into two categories: verbal - think words - and nonverbal - think visuals and 
sounds. 

Verbal hooks: words that get attention. Also - the examples I use here are from my all-
time best hooks from content and ads. So these are actual ‘winners.’

ʶ	 Labels: *Local business owners, I have a gift for you* These are words your avatar iden-
tifies with. 

ʶ	 Questions:
ű	 Yes questions: Would you pay $1,000 dollars to have the business of your dreams 

in 30 days?
ű	 Open questions: Which would you rather be?

ʶ	 Conditionals: scenarios or conditions, leading to a result, learning, or command

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 4



$100M PLAYBOOK: HOOKS THAT GET CLICKS

ű	 If you’re working all the time and your business isn’t growing, you’re working on 
the wrong sh*t.

ʶ	 Commands: Direct commands or suggestions, telling the audience to do something.
ű	 Read this if you’re tired of being broke.

ʶ	 Statements: 
ű	 The smartest thing you can do today…
ű	 How to get ahead of 99% of people.

ʶ	 Lists or Steps: 
ű	 In this video I’m going to talk to you about the 28 ways to stay poor.

ʶ	 Narratives: Stories and Anecdotes
ű	 One day I was in the back and this old lady comes in and she was piss angry.

ʶ	 Exclamations / Provocative Statements: expresses strong emotion like surprise or 
sadness

ű	 Ahhhhh… This is the blueprint to becoming a millionaire and I’m going to walk 
you through the levels

Hooks don’t have to be just words. They can also be noises or visuals. Let’s go back to 
the cocktail party. Sure, a dropped tray of dishes would get everyone’s attention, but so 
would the cling*cling*cling* of a knife against a champagne flute. They both get everyone’s 
attention for different reasons–one signals an embarrassing disaster and the other signals 
important news… but, in either case, everyone still wants to know what happens next. So if the 
platform allows, good advertisers use verbal and nonverbal hooks together. 

My Process For Finding and Creating Hooks

Once you understand the power of hooks, and see how much money they make you, 
you’ll never look back. 

My hook creation process follows Google’s 70-20-10 Innovation Rule. Larry Page and 
Sergey Brin - smarter and richer than me - proved mathematically that this resource alloca-
tion strategy got them the best returns. I don’t have the brain to prove their math, but I have 
the hands to profit from it - and so do you.

It works like this. 
70% - Core Business. You put the largest chunk of effort into doing ‘core activities.’ 

For me, that’s using hooks that are already proven in my own content or other people’s. So 
you’re basically putting the largest bucket of your effort on “more of what works.” This sta-
bilizes all advertising and guarantees a baseline of performance. Super important when your 
employees want to get paid every month, not just when stuff pops off! For example, my 
best-performing posts on X get used as hooks for shorts or captions. See below.

Core Action Step: Create a new spreadsheet. Add tabs that are for each platform you 
advertise on. Put titles across the top. To keep it simple, I put name, hook, views, and link. 
And every time I go to make content, I review my best hooks of all time. It looks like this.

20% - Emerging Business. The next 20% goes to stuff that’s promising but less proven 
than the core. Within the context of hooks, I think about it like ‘Winner Adjacent.’ So, if I 
see something that works in another niche, I may try and model the concept. See the image 
below from my team.

Core Action Step: You can subscribe to software tools that show you outliers by plat-
form. Just google it. Not trying to promote any. I use a few. They’re all a little different. If 
you’re poor or cheap, you can search the platforms you are on by the topics you talk about 
to see the highest-performing content. We paste it into a slide deck with a screenshot of the 
outlier and a few ideas of how we could repackage or reuse the formula. Here’s one from the 
same deck we’ve already used.

10% - Big New Ideas. The last 10% is for trying out totally new things. These are risky 
ideas, but they could lead to huge wins. This is where we work on our craziest ideas. We’re 
not scared to try and fail here. This part helps us stay ahead and keeps us thinking of new, 
cool stuff to make. We try out new visual formats and hooks we think might work. Like me 
catching a banana in this ad. And now that we know it worked for us, we keep doing it. It 
goes into the 70% ‘more of what works’ bucket. So if an experiment here loses, you docu-
ment it to not repeat it. And if it wins, it becomes a mainstay until something else tops it.

The 70-20-10 model helps allocate effort work to get the best returns. Most effort goes 
to what’s already working well, some to new ideas that seem promising, and a little bit to 
trying totally new things. This helps us keep making money now while also staying ahead 
for the future.

Testing The Hooks

At the end of this process, you have these mondo data sets of hooks. And since the hook 
dictates the content, and not the other way around, you no longer need to worry about what 
content to make. You’ll have more than you can possibly think of. So here’s how I translate 
these big data sets into recording. 

1)	 If I’m making ads, I record 10 or so hooks for every 1 piece of ad content. Yes, 10x. 
2)	 If I’m making short content, every winning tweet on every other platform I’ll typi-

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 8



$100M PLAYBOOK: HOOKS THAT GET CLICKS

cally reuse as a short then finish the short off by expanding on the hook. 
3)	 If I’m making long content, I record 3-4 hooks which my team looks at in post-pro-

duction to see which one they think will do better.
4)	 If I’m writing emails, we run active split tests on every campaign we send out and 

document the winners in a separate file.

Author Note: Let The Data Do The Teaching

If you have your smart cookie hat on, you’ll likely realize that all of these things 
assume that you actually have past content to look at. If you’re starting out, it’s 
even easier. You just make a bunch with no idea what’s gonna happen. Then, 
you see what happened. Then you follow 70-20-10 going forward. My promise 
is, no matter how bad your content is, some of it will be in the top 10% of that 
content. Look at the hooks for that content. Make more like that. Look at the 
bottom 10%. Make less like that. Repeat until the end of time. This is how you 
get better without a teacher. Let the data do the teaching. Most people have no 
idea anyways.

My Best Performing Hooks  

Alright. Now that we’ve gone through the appetizers, now it’s time for the main course. 
Listed here are my top 121 Hooks over the past year. This is sorted by views for content/ and 
performance for ads and emails.

I took top content hooks, top ad hooks, top posts, and top email hooks. Then, I buck-
eted all the hooks into their categories. Then, made a fancy pie chart for you. This actually 
took a lot longer than I care to admit.

And of course, here are the actual hooks, separated by platform. I added a page break 
so you can tear it out if you want. These playbooks aren’t museum pieces. They’re meant to 
be used.

Why You Should Actually Take The 
Time To Improve Your Hooks

The first impression is the strongest impression with every human, let alone, every cus-
tomer. It’s either a tailwind or headwind for your goals. The hook is that first impression. 
And for most businesses, it’s underwhelming. But when you nail it, you can unlock scale 
crazy fast.

When you nail your hooks, you…

ʶ	 Get more clicks on your content, ads, and outbound which results in more revenue
ʶ	 Get better clicks on your content, ads and outbound which results in even more 

revenue
ʶ	 Get more, better customers for the same dollars spent. This decreases your cost of 

getting customers - which either results in more revenue, more profit, or both.
ʶ	 Unlock new markets that mediocre hooks couldn’t get you into profitably
ʶ	 Unlock new levels of scale as colder traffic still converts

When you suck at hooks, you…

ʶ	 Waste money on ads that don’t work
ʶ	 Spend more money to get worse customers and make less money
ʶ	 Struggle to scale past a certain spend
ʶ	 Struggle to generate as many leads as you think you should get based on your im-

pressions
ʶ	 Get worse customers who aren’t as likely to buy
ʶ	 Get capped in all your advertising efforts, because you can’t expand.

DO YOU WANT TO SCALE YOUR BUSINESS?

Hooks are literally the first thing all customers see when they come into your 
business. They set the stage for everything to come. They last just a few seconds 
but can take weeks to perfect. Nailing them has 2x-5x-10x’d many businesses 
overnight. Misunderstanding them has done the opposite…
also overnight.

that scales,

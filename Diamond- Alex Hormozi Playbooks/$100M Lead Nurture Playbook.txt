Lead Nurture

“If they do not show, they cannot buy.”

June 2020.
COVID suffocated us. Government mandates made business all but impossible for 

brick-and-mortar gyms. Gyms, my only source of customers, were outlawed. This made it 
difficult to sell them services. How can you make money when your customers can’t make 
money? Newsflash. You can’t. Tough. 

I did what any entrepreneur would do—try and stay alive. What to do became clear. 
If I couldn’t sell to brick-and-mortar gyms anymore, I’d have to sell to somebody else. But 
this presented a whole host of other problems.  

I’d spent the last six months developing a software I called ALAN. The name was 
shorthand for Artificial Lead Automation & Nurture. It automated appointment-setting 
and reminded people to show up to those appointments...in person. All three of my 
companies relied on brick-and-mortar stores being open—and they weren’t. I felt really 
dumb. To make matters worse, the software was “pay per show.” And since no one 
was showing up to brick-and-mortar businesses, nobody was paying for the software. 
Tough. Again.

I couldn’t service businesses that did in-person sales. That meant I needed to find 
open businesses selling via phone or video. Thankfully, I found my ideal customer right 
away. After asking around, marketing agencies serving “essential businesses” had more 
work than ever. And if I got them as customers, their customers could also become my 
customers. Double whammy. And the sale was easy. I got my first ten agencies on board 
in no time. 

And since each had 10 to 50 customers, I had a few hundred customers overnight. I 
thought we would make money again. But it was a total disaster. 

The problem: None of the important gym software features transferred to other 
businesses well. I put all my energy into getting gym leads to show up for in-person 
appointments. But I also assumed it would be an easy swap to other businesses using 
phone or video appointments. And in some cases, going to the customer’s home. Nope. 
I had two weeks to figure out every type of appointment for every other type of business 
under the sun… or everyone would cancel. Even worse, they’d all hate me. And for good 
reason—the product would have failed them. I’d have failed them.

$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

For context, the tool started “managing” 4,000+ appointments per day. Managing to 
screw them up, that is. I wanted to fix it, but it just had way more data than I could ever 
hope to sift through. So I did what any reasonable entrepreneur would do—hire the best 
data person I could afford. 

Enter: Vlad (name changed to conceal his identity). Vlad won Russia’s equivalent of 
the machine learning Olympics. He was a data nerd, and brilliant. The day he came on, 
I said, “I know it’s your first day, but I only need one thing.” I opened a spreadsheet with 
about a million rows of appointment data. “I need you to figure out what gets people to 
show up to appointments.”

He stared for a moment at the document. Then, in his thick Russian accent said, 
“Yes. I can do. When do you want it?”

I said, “It’s my top priority. As soon as you can.”
He paused, then replied, “A lot of work. I think end of week.” 
“Great,” I said and started praying to the business gods. 

Friday morning.
“I finished your data,” Vlad said.
“Awesome—what did you find?”
“Four data points correlate to positive appointments.”
“Anddd??”
Vlad highlighted four columns of data. My eyes went wide with excitement. 
“Businesses managing these have more people showing up to appointments?”
“Yes,” he said. 
“How many more?” I asked.
“Many more.” Almost cracking what you might call a smirk. 
I was giddy as a schoolgirl. I might actually pull this off. Immediately, I called an 

“emergency meeting” of all the agency owners to share the news about Vlad’s show-rate 
analysis. 

First, the more time slots available, the greater the show rate.

Lead Nurture

Second, the fewer days out leads scheduled, the greater the show rate. 
Third, the more follow-ups there are, the greater the show rate. 
Fourth, the more often leads responded to follow-ups, the greater the show rate. 
These four points gave business owners something they could do to make money 

now. You can only sell somebody if they show up to buy it. And buy, they did. And we 
started making money again. And it was good. 

Vlad came on full-time and really helped us take ALAN to the next level. He found 
lots of little things that helped show rates to improve. This guide gives you everything I 
learned in that business, which I sold to a larger competitor in 2021.

Description

Getting leads to show up, like most things in business, isn’t just one thing. It’s many 
things. And like we say at Acquisition.com, “There are no silver bullets, only golden BBs.” 
Now, you can take advantage of everything I learned without spending millions of dollars 
and years of your life on software development right now. And the best part is you can 
implement and start profiting from all of it, today, for free.

First, I need to define three terms to keep us speaking the same language: schedule 
rate, show rate, and throughput. Schedule rate is the percentage of engaged leads who 
schedule an appointment. Show rate is the percentage of scheduled leads that show up to the 
appointment. Throughput is the total percentage of engaged leads that show up. Let me 
walk you through an example:

Leads: 100
Schedule Rate: 50%
Scheduled Appointments: 50
Show rate: 50%
Shown Appointments: 25
Throughput: 25% (25 shows out of 100 leads)

Show rates matter so much because the more people who show up to buy your thing, 
the more of your thing you’ll sell.

What would a 20–40% increase in revenue be worth to you? Well, if you ran 20% 
margins… it would be 2x to 3x the profit of your business—and that’s just year one. 

The problem is, most business owners don’t think much about it because they think: 
1) They can’t do anything about it 2) They don’t know what to do about it 3) They think 
they have more important stuff to do. The only acceptable response is number three—
because sometimes they do have more important stuff to do. But, in my experience, it’s 
rare to get better returns on not getting more people showing up to buy. 

I know it’s tough to see how much money you didn’t make. But, once you learn to see 
the money you didn’t make as money you’ve lost, the show rate becomes one of the most 
important numbers in your business. And the things I’m about to show you make it go 
up fast and risk-free.

Next Up: The Four Pillars of Lead Nurture

This playbook covers medium-term lead nurture - aka - maximizing 30-day show rates. 
Lead nurturing occurs after advertising and before sales. The time after they show interest 
in your thing but before they buy it. I cover “long term follow up”—aka emails, podcasts, 
and content, in other places. This playbook solves one problem: maximizing 30-day show 
rates. And, to do that, you need to understand “the four pillars” of lead nurture.

Four Pillars of Lead Nurture

You must first become consistent before you can become exceptional.

Based on all I’ve gathered from ALAN and across our portfolio companies (which 
generate upwards of 20,000 leads a day), show-ups have four main drivers:
1)	 Availability: The number of open appointment slots you have.

a)	 Example: You are open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, compared to your 
competitor, who’s only open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, 9 am to noon.

2)	 Speed to contact: How fast you respond to leads and how far out you let them 
schedule appointments.

a)	 Example: You call the lead within 42 seconds of them opting in versus your 
competitor, who, on average, takes 42 hours* to respond *(real data from 
InsideSales.com). Mind-blowing. It’s like business owners hate money.

3)	 Personalization: Making communication with leads useful and relevant to them. 
a)	 The more personal the follow-up, the more likely they’ll respond. And the 

more often they respond, the more likely they’ll show up. 
b)	 Example: You treat each lead with respect to the information they’ve provided. 

Meanwhile, your competitor just sends them templated responses. 
4)	 Volume: The number of times you reach out to leads before giving up. 

a)	 Example: You reach out to your unresponsive leads 5+ times rather than giving 
up on average after 1.3 attempts* (with 44%* of salespeople stopping after the 
first attempt) (InsideSales.com & RAIN group). As wild as it sounds—them’s 
the stats!

Taken together, if you reach out to a lead the moment they express interest, make it 
convenient for them to talk, frame the conversation as beneficial to them, and do it as 
many times as you can, more people will schedule and show up to buy your thing—no 
matter what you sell. That being said, some industries have higher show rates than others, 
but any business can become best in class within their industry at getting leads to show up.

Let’s explore the first of the four pillars—availability.

Pillar I: Availability

If leads cannot schedule, they do not show.

June 2021, on a work trip to Los Angeles.
“I need to get my nails done,” Leila, my wife, said. 
“Okay—you know anyone out here in LA?”
“No.”
“So where you gonna go?”
“I don’t know. I’ll just look on Yelp for the places closest to us.”

She called the first salon—nobody answered.*

She called the next salon*—they pick up.
“Hi there—do you have any openings within the next hour?”
“No no openings. We can get you in tomorrow.”
“No, thank you.”

She called a third salon—they pick up.
“Hi there—do you have any openings within the next hour?”
“We may have one time. Let me call you back.”
“Can you just put me on hold?”
“I have a call on the other line. I’ll call you back in a minute.” *click*

She called a fourth salon*—they pick up.
“Hi there—do you have any openings within the next hour?”
“Yep. We accept walk-ins. First & last name?”
“Leila Hormozi.”
“Is this a good number to reach you?”
“Yes, this is fine.”

“I just texted your confirmation—did you get it?”
“Yep. I got it.”
“Great, you’re going to be with Nancy. I’ll let her know to prep for you. See you soon!”

Later that month…
“You’ve gotta be kidding me…THAT’s the biggest variable for show-up rates.” I said 

to Vlad.
“Yes. very clear. An almost perfect correlation with throughput,” he replied.
“So you’re telling me, more than speed, availability is the biggest lever on getting 

more leads to show?”
“Yes. The number of days, hours per day, and time slots per hour, in aggregate, is the 

biggest predictor.”
“I mean, I guess that makes sense. One time slot will get fewer people to schedule and 

show than 100.” 
“Yes, there are diminishing returns, but large increases still at the upper quartiles 

of availability.”
“Man. This changes everything.”
The data was crystal clear for appointment-based businesses-–if leads do not schedule, 

they cannot show. And if they cannot show, they cannot buy. On an absolute basis, 
businesses with the most time slots had the most schedules, shows, and purchases. 

Description

Availability is a combination of how many appointment slots you have and how far out 
leads can schedule them. And this makes sense. If you don’t have availability when leads 
have availability, they either: a) don’t schedule at all or b) schedule at a bad time for them. 
Both stink. The first, if nobody schedules, nobody shows, and nobody buys. The second 
creates way more problems. They have a huge chance of skipping the appointment or 
“ghosting.” They’ll schedule at a time that’s bad for them, and when the appointment 
approaches, they’ll just skip it. If by some miracle they do show, they have a lower chance 
of buying because they have to manage scheduling annoyances. Third, they take a spot 
away from someone who would’ve liked the time, shown up, and bought… but now won’t! 
Let’s get to fixing it.

Pillar I: Availability

Is More Availability Worth The Cost?

Let me spoil the ending for you: Yes. Yes, it is. Now I’ve heard “I can’t be open any 
more hours” more times than I care to count. But rest assured, you can. People really 
mean it’s not worth it for me right now. And that makes sense, at least until you realize the 
giant pile of money you set on fire by making it more difficult for people to buy your 
stuff. If you make yourself more available to sell your stuff, you’ll get more chances to 
sell it. I’ve walked countless businesses through the tactics in this section and easily seen 
20–40%, sometimes 200%+ increases in appointments where people actually show up. 
And those translate straight to revenue and profits. So before you say, “I can’t,” think, 
“What would it actually cost?” and “How much money do I burn by not doing this?” 
Trust me, it’s worth it. 

Now, let’s get into the tactics.

**I made Episode 350 of my podcast, The Game, right when I first discovered 
the sheer power of availability. Check it out on episode 350 of my podcast.

Tactics

Now that we know more appointment availability means more people will show up 
to appointments to buy. Let’s make it happen. 

1) Take Appointments More Days Per Week: You pay your rent seven days per week. 
You pay payroll seven days per week. You pay insurance seven days per week. You might 
as well make money seven days per week.

$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

Wanna make 40% more sales? Start booking appointments during the 40% of the 
year people don’t. See, most people work five days per week. But by taking appointments 
seven days per week, you make your business 40% more available to accept money. A good 
idea if you want more of it. And if you’re not quite there, just rip off the Band-Aid. If 
you’re anything like me, I prefer to jump in head-first because this stuff always follows the 
same pattern. First, it sucks. Then, it works. Then I kick myself for not doing it sooner. 

2) Take Appointments More Hours Per Day: Be available to sell when your customers 
are available to buy. Not doing so would be like having a retail store open 9–5, Monday 
through Friday, and wondering where your customers are… AT WORK MAKING 
MONEY! 

For businesses that sell nationwide we found 6 am to 6 pm PST covers the highest 
percentage of sales in the US relative to the hours. You can always go beyond those hours, 
of course.

3) Give Leads More Flexible Appointment Times: Most businesses only allow leads to 
schedule every 30 or 60 minutes because they have 30- or 60-minute appointments. But 
that makes things convenient for the business, not for the lead. Consider four scheduling 
options per hour (12:00, 12:15, 12:30, 12:45, etc.) instead of one or two. Your bank 
account will thank you. Remember, you can still keep your appointments the same length, 
just give people more freedom to choose when the appointment starts. Some considerations: 

First, if you go at this alone, you’ll get some awkward times between appointments 
once in a while. But, later we will discuss how to make the time between appointments 
extremely profitable.

Second, this may take extra salespeople to handle the extra volume… a good thing. 
Most salespeople cost less than what you’d make from a 20–40% increase in revenue.

Last, if you qualify people and close them on separate calls (which I recommend 
for more expensive stuff), then a 15-minute qualifying call solves this issue entirely. The 
people who qualify leads and the people who close them just have separate schedules. It 
works like a charm. And makes more money, too.

4) Have Inbound, Outbound, and Self-Scheduling Options. You can call leads to set 
appointments. Leads can call you to set appointments. And leads can schedule themselves 
online. Do all three. The more ways you give people to book an appointment, the more 
people will book an appointment. It’s that simple. 
A few tips to make online schedulers work better:

Pillar I: Availability

1)	 Make sure the header confirms they’re in the right place. Then, tell them the 
next thing to do and why to do it. (Header - Headline - Subheadline). See 
below for clarification for what the top of the page should look like. Header = 
**Attention Avatar**. Headline and subheadline are self-explanatory.

2)	 Make available dates and times super obvious as soon as the page loads. You 
want the time slots to be visible. This goes for mobile and desktop.

3)	 Eliminate as many steps as possible. And if leads already gave you relevant info 
earlier in the scheduling process, don’t make them do it again. Tech now exists 
to eliminate fields they’ve already filled out and it creates huge improvements 
in schedule rates. Do not underestimate this.

Author Note: My First Online Scheduler

When I started doing this, there weren’t any online schedulers. Or at least, I 
hadn’t seen anyone using them. So the first version of my thank you page for 
people opting into my gym was—“Thank you , you’ll be getting a text from 
XXX-XXX-XXXX shortly to book a time.” Then, I had the brilliant idea of 
putting an image of Leila and saying “Leila will be reaching out to you at this 
number.” Then finally, I had an even more brilliant idea: “Text Leila at this 
number with the time that works for you to come in.” And that CRUSHED. 
Apparently no one cared about faceless Alex. But as soon as they saw a 
picture of a young in shape girl—both men and women were more likely to 
book.

Author Note: Solution For Too Many Bad Appointments

Eliminating friction will increase the number of appointments booked. This 
is the first step to getting a show. But sometimes, you have too many bad 
appointments on your calendar. When that happens—it’s okay to add friction. 
Add a video to watch before they see the scheduler. Add a sales letter above 
the scheduler, so they have to read it before booking a time. Add a price 
to the page so people know what they’re in for. Delay when the scheduler 
appears to make sure people are sufficiently qualified to book a time. These 
are just a few ways to decrease appointments and increase quality.

These are simple. And yet, no one does them. Most are afraid of the extra cost. But it’s 
not about how much it costs. It’s about return on investment. And, in my experience, it’s a 
lot. More schedules. More shows. More sales. Good trade.

Next up, we have speed. And yes, there’s more to it than meets the eye.

Pillar II: Speed

Money loves speed. Wealth loves time. Poverty loves indecision.

Statistic #1: A 391% increase in sales conversions occurs when leads are contacted within 
the first 60 seconds. Velocify.
Statistic #2: Companies that contact customers within an hour were 7x as likely to qualify 
the leads as calling even an hour later. And 60x more likely than companies that waited 
24 hours. Harvard Business Review.
Statistic #3: 78% of customers buy from the company that responds to their inquiry first. 
Lead Connect.

So… where do we go from here? Yeah, probably call leads faster. Now, you’re probably 
thinking this has similar obstacles to availability. And it does. Namely, it sounds like a 
pain in the neck. It will cost you, and it will make you way more than it costs. What other 
single change can get a 4x+ increase in sales? Not many things. 

Like availability, the cost of getting to all leads immediately is excess capacity. Meaning 
you have people on your sales team or front desk who are not going to have fresh leads 
all the time. The alternative is people are busy, and leads wait. But leads waiting to be 
contacted leaves the door open for other competitors to steal them. Or, more realistically, 
for boredom, distraction, and disengagement to steal them. No bueno. Let’s avoid that.

How To Increase Speed To Contact

I increase speed in three ways. 
1)	 Speed To First Contact 
2)	 Speed To First Appointment
3)	 Speed Of Response

1) Speed To First Contact : First contact refers to how long it takes you to call or message 
leads after they express interest in your stuff. For example, when they reply to ads, join 
your list, or self-schedule. And the stats at the beginning of this section tell a chilling 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 13



$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

story—just how much money business owners burn by making first contact too slow. 
But, if you made the availability changes, especially the time slot one, your team will now 
have some gaps in their calendars. And guess what they have now… time to immediately 
contact leads. So we don’t waste time at all. We use it to contact our leads way faster.

This reveals another massive benefit to making “contact all leads in five minutes or 
less” the gold standard. The slower you contact leads, the more times you have to contact 
them before they buy. The faster you contact leads, the fewer times you have to contact 
them before they buy. So if you work your leads faster, you won’t have to work them as 
much—a rare instance where “work less to make more” is actually true.

Pro Tip: Speed Litmus Test

If you aren’t getting “man that was fast! You guys are on top of it!” At least 
once a day, you’re not calling your leads fast enough. Why wouldn’t you want 
to impress someone as a first impression and make more money?

2) Speed To First Appointment

Speed To First Appointment means the amount of time between scheduling a sales 
appointment and having the sales appointment. The shorter the delay between scheduling 
appointments and having them, the higher the show rate gets. And more people showing up 
to sales appointments means more people buying your stuff. I recommend two things to 
make appointments happen sooner. 

Limit people to scheduling three days out max. Again, the sooner they schedule, the 
better. If you let people schedule meetings much beyond three days, you’ll get more 
people to schedule, but you’ll also have more people ghosting. A triple loss. First, because 
a person ghosted you. Second, because enough ghosted meetings kills the morale of the 
sales team. And third, because the ghost stole a convenient time from a person who may 
have otherwise bought.

Ex: If today is Monday, you want Tuesday and Wednesday to be available. Always 
72 hours in advance. Why? Because appointments that schedule closer, show higher. So, 
make that the policy. 

Note: You can get away with five days if you have to, I just prefer three. In either case, 
keep tabs on show rates and find the sweet spot for your business.

Pillar II: Speed

Pro Tip: Get Leads To Schedule Sooner: Crush Scheduling Obstacles

If leads don’t want to schedule within the next 72hrs, we see that as an 
obstacle. It’s rare that someone can’t actually make time for something if it’s 
important. So let me tell you a little tip I learned from my gym days. 

When I’d call a lead, I’d ask them what days they planned on working out. This 
would give me multiple days per week. As soon as I had that, I would use the 
time they said they wanted to work out to justify that this appointment is 
the first step. This thinking process applies to anything. If you have a service 
where someone has to do something, the time they planned on doing it, you 
can ask up front and then use that time as when they can come in/schedule.

Pull appointments forward—preferably to that day. Show rates for same-day 
appointments are higher than not same day. And show rates for I’m talking to you right 
now are 100%. So that becomes the objective. When we call to schedule people, we have 
five possible outcomes. 

1)	 Doesn’t respond. We would remove this person from the calendar (or double 
book if in-person). 

2)	 Contacted and unqualified. Remove from the calendar and give free useful stuff 
or references if you can. Or—if you have an appropriate downsell, you can offer it.

3)	 Contacted, qualified, and free right now. This is the best scenario. You’re guaranteed 
a show because you’re already talking to them. If the same people set and close, 
just go for the close. If not, do a “hot handoff” to an active closer. I’ll show you 
how in a second. 

4)	 Contacted, qualified, and pulled appointment forward. I’ll give you the script in 
a second.

5)	 Contacted, qualified, and appointment confirmed.

Here’s how to make this work in the real world: 
Remember that time we bought ourselves between appointments? Right. If there are 

no fresh leads to contact and schedule, then calling leads who self-scheduled to pull their 
appointments forward becomes the second priority. The script goes like this:

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 15



$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

Hey, this is Jim… calling from XYZ on a recorded line… I saw that you just booked a 
time for our X on Monday. Just calling to confirm some details before your appointment. Is 
now a terrible time?

(WHO) Great… So I see you are a [qualification 1], is that right? Awesome.
(WHAT THEY WANT) And you’re looking to [qualification 2], is that correct? 
(WHAT THEY’RE STRUGGLING WITH) And what are the things you’ve tried so far?
Got it. What else? Got it. So this is a priority for you to fix or [bad thing] happens. Is that 

fair to say?
Okay great. Well, two things. First, good news: I think we can help you out. Second, better 

news: I have an opening that canceled later today at 4 pm for us to get you all squared away… 
unless now is a good time? 

You either go into the sale after qualifying them, move up their appointment, or, 
worst case, you qualify them and re-confirm their time. Which if you need to do that, 
you say:

No worries at all. We always like to offer more times to make it convenient. We want to 
cost you as little time as possible. So we’re all good for two days from now at 4 pm. Is there any 
reason you think you won’t be able to make that appointment?

Then, you either text them a confirmation from your phone if you’re having the 
appointment, OR you connect them in a three-way message with the closer who is going 
to take the appointment (this is the hot hand off I referenced last page).

If you are connecting with someone else, you then take a second to edify the person 
they’re going to speak with. It would go something like this:

You’re in luck. You’re actually going to speak with one of our top experts on X. He’s been 
in this game for a while and helped Y [businesses, people that you match to their description] 
achieve [thing that they want]. We’re fortunate to have him. He’ll definitely be able to help you 
with that. Let me check his calendar really quickly. [pause] (if you changed their time) Yep - 
I’m gonna slide you in so you can get this taken care of ASAP. (if you didn’t change the time) 
Yep - you’re all confirmed and good to go.

The moment we get off the call, I’m going to introduce you to him via text message. Does the 
XYZ number work? Great. Alright. Have an amazing day, and enjoy your time with CLOSER.

Once you do that, you’ve worked your leads and optimized their outcomes for 
maximum possible show-ups. And yes, it probably means your current sales team is 
understaffed for maximum selling. Opportunity for improvement!

16 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Pillar II: Speed

With that being said, we go to the third element of speed: responsiveness leading up 
to appointments.

3) Speed of Response

The last element of speed is how fast you get back to leads after they schedule 
their appointment and before it happens. This is where leads “fall through the cracks.” 
Fortunately for us, and unfortunately for our competitors, leads often make buying 
decisions before the sales call, and that makes it the competitor’s sale to lose. Imagine 
two scenarios:

Scenario #1: You opt in. You get contacted immediately. Confirm your appointment. 
Then, after you get off the call, you text a question. No one responds until the next 
business day. What do you do? You probably assume they’re scattered and disorganized. 
You probably stop asking questions because you don’t feel like waiting again. But let’s say 
you decide to send another message. Now, they respond the next business day again. Not 
a good experience, right? You may as well communicate by carrier pigeon. You feel like 
they’re not prioritizing you—because they’re not. If they don’t show up for you, why bother 
showing up for them? 

Scenario #2: You opt in. You get contacted immediately. Confirm your appointment. 
Then, after you get off the call, you text a question. They immediately respond. You ask 
another question. Ding! Another response back. Then - ding! - the closer adds context. 
You got your question and follow-up question answered within a minute. These guys are 
on top of it!

Which one is better? Obviously scenario two. 
Every messaging service provides time stamps. Use them. Every incoming call and 

outgoing call has a time stamp. Use them. And plenty of software exists to consolidate 
it all. So, if show rates drop, look here first—especially if they drop for a particular rep. 
Their performance will also show who puts in the extra time. And you best encourage 
that (if you want to make more money) because, after all, leads never sleep.

Speed Summary

You gotta be fast. You need to reach out quickly. And you gotta get them in a sales 
meeting as soon as possible. If you do, you’ll contact more of them, follow up less, and 
sell more. When you speak to them, aim to set appointments inside 72 hours. So—same 
day, next day, day after. Or, of course, sell them right then and there. And if, for whatever 
reason, you haven’t scheduled the appointment, or you did schedule and they reach back 
out, respond fast! It’ll show them you’re serious and prevent undoing all the hard work 
you did to get them.

Next up

So, we’ve covered availability and speed. If you only did those things, you’d make 
a lot more money. But we’ve still got a lot more money on the table. Let’s grab it! Next 
stop: personalization.

18 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Pillar III: Personalization

Personalize, don’t pressure.

In 2020, one of our ALAN beta testers had show rates well beyond any of the other 
businesses in the test group. I tried to figure out what in particular they did, but I found 
nothing. They had the same open loop conversations, the same messages, the same 
cadence—it all looked the same. But they did so much better… Why?

I reached out to the business owner and asked if he did anything special. He, of 
course, said no. Then, we reviewed his ad campaigns together. They also looked pretty 
normal. He shrugged and said, “I guess we’ve just got people who love us.” It caught me 
off guard. 

“What do you mean, they love you? They’re leads, they don’t even know you yet.”
“Well, yea. I mean, we try and over-deliver so they want to show up.”
“What do you mean?”
“We give them a gift when they get here.”
“Do you tell them?”
“Yea, we text them on a separate iPhone outside of the system”—aha! No wonder I 

couldn’t see it—and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got a shirt here waiting for you. Do you prefer black or 
pink?’ And as soon as they respond with a color—we’ve got em.”

“Wait. So if someone tells you the color they want, they show up?”
“Yea, almost every time.”

Bingo. That was it. But this time, it’s personal. 

Description

Personalization means making yourself useful, relevant, and pleasant to individual 
leads. So, we figure out what they want, get that thing for them, and then tell them they 
can have it if they show up. If the lead knows they’ll get value just for showing up, then 
their chance of showing up goes up with it. Nobody wants to waste their time, so this 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 19



$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

lowers their risk. Plus, it raises their opportunity cost. If they skip it, they miss out on 
getting something they find valuable. This makes the value of the appointment itself much 
higher. So we want to remove the risk of not getting what they want. And by extension, 
increase the likelihood they show up to get it.

Now that we understand the concept, let’s get tactical.

Personalization Tactics

I personalize to boost show rates in six ways. They are:
1)	 Use The Lead’s Preferred Communication Method - Talking to leads where they want 

to talk.
2)	 Qualify The Leads - Collect data then remove leads from the calendar that are unlikely 

to buy, to free up time for those who are more likely to buy. 
3)	 Best Leads to Best Closers - Connect the leads most likely to buy with the reps most 

likely to close. 
4)	 Segment Your Messaging - Talk to leads about stuff relevant to them.
5)	 Incentivize Showing Up - Give them a reason (or multiple reasons) to show up. 
6)	 Demonstrate Proof - Show the successes and positive experiences of people just like 

them.

1) Use The Lead’s Preferred Communication Method 

How do you initiate contact with leads after they opt-in? Text? Email? Direct Message? 
Phone Call? The answer? All of them. Kinda. Hear me out. 

You want to start communication in multiple ways but continue communication 
where they respond. So, when someone opts in, message them on multiple social media 
platforms, text, call, and email. The works. Then, wherever they respond, prioritize that 
medium for them. Eventually, you’ll get people on the phone, on a video call, or in 
person. But, to get things started, take the path of least resistance.

Let’s say we call, text, DM, and email a lead, but they respond via DM first. What 
do we do? Continue the conversation there. We can switch to a richer medium later (like 
phone call, Zoom, or video call). This sounds basic, but so many people only reach out 
one time on one platform. Big mistake.

20 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Pillar III: Personalization

Also, you’ve gotta reach out like you’re actually trying to get ahold of them—not just 
going through the motions. Think about it. Imagine you needed to get ahold of your 
parents because of some issue. What would you do? You would call multiple times, text, 
DM them, and maybe even email them. You would call their friends to see if they know 
where they are. Or the front desk if they live in a building. You would do whatever it took 
to get a hold of them. 

These leads need you to help them. You only do them a disservice by not reaching out 
to them like you mean it especially after they said they wanted help! So, reach out in 
multiple ways in multiple places.

Bottom line: You will get higher initial response rates by starting conversations in as 
many ways as you can, and then continuing conversations in the way they prefer. 

2) Qualify The Leads

A while back, I got to look under the hood of a weight loss company with exceptional 
show percentages and high profits—especially for their small size and boring product. 
What I saw shocked me… they actively canceled sales appointments. Blasphemy! 

On the one hand, this owner clearly hated money. Who cancels sales appointments!? 
On the other hand, he made way more money in weight loss than most anyone else. So 
what gives? This conundrum led me to do what any other curious person would do—ask 
about it. And I found the answer surprisingly refreshing. 

 “Every lead fills out an application before the sales call,” he said. “And, based on 
their answers, I can just tell who is going to be a fit. And that’s when it dawned on me. 
He’s qualifying his leads. As a result, he spends way more time working good leads and 
completely ignores the bad ones. Brilliant. 

3) Send The Best Leads To The Best Closers

Around the same time, I got introduced to a guy who lived in my building. He was 
the number one sales rep for the number one timeshare company in the US. They have 
nearly 3,000 sales reps, and he finished first in five out of the last six years. I was obviously 
interested to hear what he had to say.

At dinner, I asked him, “So what’s your secret?” A grin spread across his face. He put 
his arms on the table and leaned in. “When I finally won my first year, I got to have a 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 21



$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

sixty-minute meeting with the CEO. Normally it’s just a formality, and nothing happens. 
But, I was determined to change things. He asked me what I thought we could do to drive 
more sales. I told him, ‘You’re wasting all the good leads on these junior reps. Meanwhile, 
I waste two-thirds of my time with people who have 500 credit scores. Just give me the 
best leads, and I’ll make you a lot of money.’ It took me the rest of the time to convince 
him to just try it at my local office. The next year I 5x’d the production of the office. They 
then rolled it out nationwide, and the company went from $200M to $1B a year in sales 
over the next five years.” He leaned back on his chair, satisfied with his accomplishment.

 And, as obvious as this all was, I hadn’t even been doing it in my own companies! I 
began implementing it and profiting immediately.

Step 1 :	 Look at your best customers. The actions they take and the people they 
are (demographics).

Step 2 :	 Ask those questions in your opt-ins, applications, and during the time before 
sales appointments.

Step 3 :	 Score leads on a 1–5 or red-yellow-green system based on how qualified 
they are.

Step 4 :	 Route your best leads to your best closers.
Step 5 :	 Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

4) Segment Your Messaging

Plain and simple, we want the right message for the lead. For instance, Hubspot 
improved their email marketing ROI by 7x after segmenting their list. So, now that you 
have your leads segmented via scoring, nurture them in a way that’s more aligned with 
what you know about them. That’s easy to say, so I’ll break this into two versions: easy 
and hard. 

Easy: The simplest version of this is to look at their profiles, look up their websites, and 
search them. See what they’ve recently done. It takes five minutes of preparation before you 
speak with a lead—or, reach out to them to get way higher response rates. Now that you 
know the good leads from the bad ones, start doing your homework on the good ones.

For example, you might say, “Hey Greg, I see that your site traffic is down 18% this 
quarter, we had another customer in a similar situation. They’re now up 100% 90 days later. 
I prepped a walkthrough to show you how we can apply the same principles to your auto shop.”

22 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Pillar III: Personalization

At the very least, when you introduce yourself to the lead, have some idea of who they 
are and mention it upfront and early. People are more likely to listen and pay attention to 
someone who behaves like someone they know.

Hard: This one takes more time upfront but less on a regular basis. Set up emails 
and texts for every category of lead that comes in. For example, if you ask businesses 
their revenue level, have a different sequence for businesses of that revenue level. If you 
ask people their desired weight loss, send them case studies and content relevant to that 
amount of weight. Make your nurture sequences specific to the pains these people deal 
with. 

Just bite the bullet. Drink your energy drinks. Block a weekend. And just go ham. 
Get all the text and email sequences lined up for each situation. Once you have it, you’ll 
thank me later for your higher responses.

Bottom Line: More schedules. More Shows.

Pro Tip: Get Your Team iPhones For Texting

Spam, automated messages, and other junk most often come as (green?) 
messages. Most messages from real humans come as blue messages. If you 
send blue messages, you’ll get more responses. The tech will change over 
time, but if there’s ever something like this in the future where it’s a ‘pseudo-
human’ verification, I would invest in it. It’s always been worth the increased 
response rates. 

Pro Tip: Local Area Code Call Wrapping

Local area codes have significantly higher pick up rates than unrecognized or 
out of the area codes. There’s technology that can dynamically switch your 
area code when calling prospects to their local area. This results in higher 
pick up rates (by a lot). I recommend the investment.

5) Incentives

I’ve seen incentives used in two ways: “push” and “pull.” A push incentive means 
they do the good stuff before they arrive with the intention to evoke reciprocity. A pull 
incentive means the lead gets good stuff after they arrive with the intention to motivate 
the action. Both are a kind of social contract.

Gift Card “Push” Incentive: The first way I’ve seen this used is—you simply give the 
lead a gift card. I wouldn’t obsess about the amount. Just make it enough that it isn’t 
insulting. And to be clear, they get the gift card you send whether they show or not. This is a 
gift. And gifts have no strings. Here’s how it would sound in reality: 

“Hey Name! I just wanted to make sure you are caffeinated for our meeting tomorrow. 
Check your email. I just sent you a $5 gift card.” 

And what do ya know, more of them show up. And yes, you can do this with any 
business. Let’s say you have a brick-and-mortar beauty chain. It would go like this:

Prospect opts in → They get a call within 5 minutes → I say: 
“Hey Name! Since you are a first-time client, I’m going to set aside some free products for 

you. Would you want face cream or hand lotion? 
“Face cream!”
“Awesome, I will have it waiting for you tomorrow.” 
This strategy hinges on reciprocity. And here’s the crazy part. Even when people know 

what you’re doing—it still works. They feel like they owe you one. Which also means an 
increase in close rate. Not the point of this playbook—but—it doesn’t hurt. 

A/B “Pull” Incentive: The first incentive was a gift. The second is a bribe. Here’s how 
it works:

Leads choose what they get when they show up. But both choices assume they’ll show. 
But you want to show you’re incurring a cost on their behalf. 

You can make anything an A/B offer. Just to give you a few ideas… Quantity (Do you 
want one bottle or two?), start dates (start tomorrow or Monday?), type (shirt or shorts?), 
payment preference (cash or card?), flavors (chocolate or vanilla?), time slots (morning or 
afternoon?), media (read or listen?), delivery speeds (standard or overnight?), sizes (small 
or medium?), colors (black or white?), materials (paper or plastic?), personnel (John or 
Sara?), communication (call or text?). Again, with some creativity, you can make anything 
an A/B offer. 

24 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Pillar III: Personalization

A/B Incentives depend on three things. First, leads should want the thing. Second, it 
should have obvious connections to the thing you’ll offer them. Last, that you incurred 
some real cost by preparing it. 

6) Proof

Showing people proof, case studies, and other testimonials gets people excited to 
talk to you about your product or service. When people get excited to talk to you about 
it, more show up ready to buy. So weave your proof into messaging. And—if you want 
to be a super ninja—personalize it. Match the proof to the lead. If you are talking to 
an older white male professional, then show him the results of other older white male 
professionals. If you are talking to a female weight loss lead, send her a lead of someone 
her age, ethnicity, and around her weight, and so on. The closer the match, the better. 
Obviously be compliant with the proof you send—which varies by state and country. 
Weave your proof in:

After they schedule and before they show.
Between the first and second call.
If they ghost, every 90 days. Show them the results of people who signed up about 

when they ghosted. This makes them feel left behind but still gives them the option to 
make up for lost time.

I made an entire playbook on Proof, so I won’t go into more detail here. But—weave 
it everywhere you can. It makes your stuff more compelling, and this will motivate more 
of them to show. 

Personalization Summary

I increase show rates using personalization in six ways: 1) Use multiple communication 
channels initially, then continue where leads respond first. 2) Qualify leads through 
applications, then focus time on the most promising prospects while canceling 
appointments with poor fits. 3) Route your best leads to your best closers by scoring 
them on a 1–5 or color-coded system based on qualification criteria derived from your 
top customers. 4) Segment messaging to ensure relevance, either by researching each 
lead before contact or creating different nurture sequences for each lead category. 5) 
Offer incentives through either “push” methods (giving gifts before appointments to 
create reciprocity) or “pull” methods (offering A/B choices that assume attendance and 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 25



$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

demonstrate you’ve incurred costs on their behalf ). 6) Show personalized proof through 
testimonials and case studies that match the lead’s demographics, creating excitement and 
motivation to attend.

Bottom line: Figure out what leads want, get that thing for them, and then tell them 
they can have it if they show up, effectively removing the risk of wasting time while 
increasing the cost of missing the appointment.

Next Up…

So we’ve made it convenient for our leads to schedule. We’ve contacted them as fast as 
we can. We’ve collected as much information as we can about them so we can personalize 
the medium we talk on, the messaging we tell them, the salesman we match them with, 
the gift we provide, and the proof we show them. This leads us to the last of our four 
pillars to get insane show rates—Volume.

Pillar IV: Volume

Volume negates luck.

In my experience, the more often I reach out to leads, the more of them show up. 
That makes sense because most communication attempts fail. For example, you may 
have called or messaged at an inconvenient time. They might’ve wanted to respond, then 
forgot. Or maybe they simply missed it in the flurry of other communications they get. 
Or, in the case of older leads, maybe they didn’t need your stuff then, but they do now—
and you gave them a nice reminder.

For all those reasons, reaching out again not only makes business sense, it makes 
ethical sense. Remember, if they opted in, they asked to be contacted. So, contact them. 

The problem: nearly half of all salespeople give up after the first attempt. No bueno. 
Time to change that.

Description

Volume simply means the number of times you do something. In this case, the number 
of times you reach out to leads before giving up. Our goal is to increase the volume 
of reach-outs to get more responses, schedules, and then shows. I break volume into 
three parts:

1)	 Scheduling appointments
2)	 Reminding them to show 
3)	 Booking their next appointment when they show up for their current appointment 
Let’s dive in.

1) Scheduling Appointments

1)	 Call leads within 5min of opting in. Seriously, once you get this, you will see an 
increase in show rate and close rate. I can’t tell you how many times someone’s 
said, “That was fast. You guys are a great business,” and buy right away!

2)	 Double-dial. If you call once and get nothing, immediately call again. First,

remember they gave you permission to contact them, so contact them like you 
mean it. Second, you will call from a strange number, and many phones block the 
first call and let the second call through. So even if they expect your call, they may 
miss it anyway. *Note: Obey the laws of your area.*

3)	 If nothing, leave a voicemail. 
4)	 Send a text immediately after you leave the voicemail.
5)	 Double dial and text two more times that day. Make sure to leave a few hours 

between each attempt.
6)	 Call two times for the next two days. Once earlier in the day and once later in the 

day. Text after the second call each day.
7)	 Call and text once a day for the next four days. If you reach out earlier in the week, this 

gets the people who respond more often on weekends. If you do your initial reach-outs 
later in the week, the higher volume days will probably get them anyway.

8)	 After the first week, I transition to long-term nurture. I cover this in other places. 
Long-term nurture consists of free value with soft calls to action to get them to 
re-engage. And once they do, we start back at the top.

The more days that pass, the less likely they’ll schedule. For that reason, we front-load 
the reach-outs. Steps 6 and 7 stay flexible, you can do it for more days or fewer. I just 
showed you what I prefer. As always, follow the laws in your area.

Pro Tip: Get An Automatic Dialer

For businesses’ sake, get a phone dialer. It will improve the efficiency of 
your team 2-3x easily. It will automatically bring up the highest likelihood 
leads and stick with the cadence. And, your sales team doesn’t need to live 
on spreadsheets and sticky notes. It’ll help you focus your full attention on 
actually working your leads.

Pillar IV: Volume

2) Reminding Them To Show

 Automated Reminders
Once you get the person scheduled, or they automatically schedule themselves, send 

them automated reminders. But make it clear they are automated. People don’t mind 
reminders. They do mind being lied to. If you’re following the instructions from the speed 
pillar, you don’t need to send that many anyways. It’ll look something like this:

1)	 Immediately: Automatic confirmation of time, date, number you’ll be calling 
from, and person they’re meeting with.

2)	 24 hours before.
3)	 12 hours out.
4)	 3 hours from the appointment.

Automated Reminder Tips:

ʶ	 Use the standard reminders that come with whatever software you use. Just let 
leads know you’ve automated them. Here’s an example:

ʶ	 Add the area code you’ll be calling from. You’ll 2x your pick-up rates. 
ʶ	 Use the lead’s local time zone. Thank me later.

Pillar IV: Volume

4)	 Then, ask the next question. This is where you can pull up the appointment if 
you haven’t already. Ex: “I’ve actually got an opening today at 4 if you’re available 
later today. If not, no worries.”
Remember: Once they respond—keep nurturing! Keep responding quickly. 

3) Book Their Next Appointment At The Current Appointment

We bought an insurance company over a year ago. The biggest constraint was prospects 
dropping off between the first and second call. And between those calls the reps would 
make and send them the plans they best qualified for. Lots of work. Low return. We made 
one change to their lead nurture process, which I got from my friend Sharran Srivatsaa. 
He called it BAMFAM or “Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting.” 

Here’s how it works: NEVER get off the call with “We’ll circle back later.” or “I’ll 
follow up and propose some times.” You’re both there. Right now. Pull up your darn 
calendar. Pick a darn time. If you can’t schedule an appointment with them right then and 
there, you CERTAINLY won’t after you’ve put them in limbo and they’ve put you in their 
rearview mirror. 

Internally, we call it “BAMFAM as a way of life.” Someone being dodgy about their 
next call is an objection. Handle it. And your sales will thank you. 

People have a higher chance of showing up to appointments if you schedule them. 
You have the highest chance of scheduling an appointment if you do it with them in real 
time. For that reason, it makes the most sense to schedule the next appointment during 
the current appointment. Sharran’s BAMFAM suggestion skyrocketed the second-call show 
rates and the insurance company sales increased. Go figure. 

Volume Summary: 

You reach out seven or more times in multiple ways. You send automated reminders 
24 hours, 12 hours, and 3 hours out from their appointment. You send manual reminders 
from a real cell phone the night before, the morning of, and an hour before their 
appointment. Keep it personal. Then, once they show, if they don’t close, don’t delay. Get 
them booked for their next appointment right there and then so no one falls through the 
cracks.

The only thing left to do is execute. And since that’s the most important part, I’m 
dedicating a chapter to explain the things that have worked well for us to get more leads 
in the door. Time to execute.

Execution

Do the boring work.

Seven or eight years ago…
I went over to my neighbor’s house. They introduced me to Jacob, their fifteen-year-old 

son. He’d always hang around when we’d talk about business. But he never spoke. One 
day, I asked him what he wanted to do—and he said make money. I laughed. I told him 
he could come work out with me during the summer. He showed up every day, like 
clockwork. He never wasted the opportunity.

Within a few years, he went to college. He came back during his first semester, 
dissatisfied with school. I asked him again what he wanted. His response remained 
unchanged—to make money.

I came downstairs from taking calls. Jacob was sitting in my kitchen on the phone. As 
I walked up to him, I overheard, “...yea… so… I was just wondering…are you trying to 
sell your house… no… yea… no… oh okay…” then he looked up at me. 

“What was that?” I asked.
“Oh, I’m trying to wholesale real estate.”
“How are you gonna do that?”
“Watching videos online.”
“How many deals have you done?”
“Uhh… none. I’m not sure I’m doing it right.”
“No sh*t. Have you heard yourself? ...You sound like a stoned teenager. No one is 

gonna do a deal with you until you learn how to sell.”
“Well, how do I do that?”
I thought for a long minute, then replied, “Listen. I can get you a job interview. 

That’s it. It’s gonna be up to the manager if he wants to hire you. But I’ve got openings on 
my cold call team. You’ll get hundreds of reps in everyday. It’s sink or swim.”

“I’ll do whatever it takes.:”
“Good man.”

The next week.
I walked downstairs to meet up with Jacob for our workout. He had a grin across 

his face.
“What’s got you in a good mood?” I asked.
“I got the job,” he replied proudly.
“Good on you. Alright. But getting the job is the easy part. Succeeding is the 

hard part. Here’s what you need to do. Everyone else on the team is going to hit their 
150-call-per-day quota. If you want to be number one, which, if you’re hanging out with 
me, that is what I expect of you, then you need to work harder than everyone else.”

“I will.”
“Okay. So to be clear, I want you to look at what the top guy on the team is doing, 

then do double that. So he’s making 200 calls a day, I need you to make 400. If he works 
five days, you work six. If he takes a lunch break, you power through. You can’t do the 
same amount as him because then he’ll always be ahead. I need you to catch up. And you 
can only do that by doing more.”

A few weeks later.
“Man—some of these leads just aren’t qualified.”
“And?”
“Just feels like a waste of time.”
“Let me give you a reframe. Instead of thinking of them as a waste of time. Think 

of them as giving you the ultimate gift—free practice. You can still take them through 
the script, hear their objections etc. I remember when I had someone who walked into 
my gym. They looked obviously homeless. I remember thinking to myself: if I can close 
this guy on getting in shape and turning his life around, I could really change his life. 
End result: he ended up giving me a small deposit towards starting and never showed up 
again. But the interesting thing is—this perspective of seeing all opportunities as ‘swings 
of the hammer to chisel our skillset’ never made me feel like I was wasting my time with 
a lead. It was all free practice. And later, I ended up finding out something even more 
important… some people who look homeless are actually very wealthy and appreciate 
not being judged. So—be an equal opportunity salesman. Do not judge. Just execute.”

“Understood.”

Execution

After this conversation, Jacob got the nickname “garbage man.” He offered to take all 
the under-qualified leads from the whole team. The older guys didn’t have his ambition. 
They just wanted to cherry-pick. So they gave him all their “garbage” leads. And he would 
turn them into sales.

Over time, he developed a little moniker, “Yellow is the new gold.”
Our lead scoring system was simple. Reds are truly unqualified. Yellows are less 

qualified. Greens are prime leads. As you can imagine, there were plenty of yellows. Most 
of their guys would give their yellows to Jacob and he would take them in off-hours and 
weekends. And he just kept closing them. Over time he started saying, “Yellows are the 
new gold.” And, for a salesman or business owner with the right perspective—they are.

***

Jacob rose through the ranks and finished his tenure at Gym Launch as the top salesman 
the quarter he left, out of 26 guys. Many of them, grown men. I tell his story from my 
perspective so you can figuratively ride along. He then came with me to Acquisition.com 
to be the Director of Sales and help our portfolio companies use our methodologies to 
compliantly sell more prospects. And one of the first principles he teaches new salespeople 
is - be a garbage man - yellows are golds - volume negates luck - BAMFAM as a way of 
life - and every sale is an opportunity for free practice. 

These little -isms’ permeate the culture of the team. A spirit of humility. No one is 
above the work. The work and the process sits on a pedestal. And all we can do is do our 
best to strive towards the ideal.

Tactics

The hardest part about working leads is… actually working your leads. It’s tedious, 
boring work. But, it gets very unboring results. I spent the time to tell you that story 
because once you know what to do the key to doing it is culture. And rather than make 
this some management mumbo jumbo, I will explain how I create a culture of execution.

Culture refers to the rules that govern good and bad behavior in an organization. Simple 
as that. We want to have a culture of execution. Or accepting of the behaviors that make us 
available, fast, personal, and persistent. And reject the behaviors that make us unavailable, 
slow, boring, and fragile.

Good stuff: Good stuff typically falls into money & non-money. The money is 
straightforward. Include a small commission bump for show-up rates. This will depend 
on the ticket price of the sale, but usually, it’s in the neighborhood of 5–30% of what a 
salesman makes on a sale.

Non-monetary good stuff falls into three categories: attention, affection, and approval. 
So, that means we: give kudos to people who have the highest show rates. We ask them 
what they did. Then, when they invariably say, “I just followed the process,” we give them 
more approval and attention. And the team will toss in the small -isms like “way to do 
the boring work,” “volume negates luck,” “speed is king,” etc. And those little sayings 
reinforce the right behaviors. And conversely, if someone has a very high close rate but 
doesn’t work their leads—in our culture, that’s seen as entitled and wasteful. And that 
person is made aware of it.

So tactically, we rank the team by show rate, close rate, and total call-to-close 
percentage. This takes both skills into account: working leads and closing leads. This 
shows a holistic picture of the team. If you’re doing a good job—the same guys will be at 
the top of all lists. If you’re not, the lists will look more all over the place. The nurture list 
measures work ethic. The closing list measures skill. And one typically leads to the next. 
Tip: something I discovered way too late… the best closers are typically the best setters. 
So—it’s a great way to have new guys come on in a low-risk environment. If they can set 
a ton of leads, they can usually close. Same skill set—just higher stakes.

As an aside—I still don’t understand why all businesses don’t track all three sets of 
metrics by sales rep. They’re so obsessed with close rates. But the only thing that actually 
matters is the conversion rate on the leads you’ve got. And that takes everything into 
account. So you might as well take everything into account when paying and giving status 
to your team.

Execution Conclusion

Like my other Playbooks, I do not say that my way is the only way. It’s just my way. 
And it’s worked pretty well so far. To put a bow on it, to get the highest percentage of 
leads to show, you need to:

1)	 Convenience - Make it as easy as possible for them to schedule and show up.
2)	 Speed - Contact them as quickly as possible from the time they indicate 

interest. Prospects have large motivation for only tiny moments in time. 
Capitalize on it.

Execution

3)	 Personalization - Increase the likelihood they show by demonstrating to them 
this is just for them, the way they want it. Show you’re a real person, and you’ll 
treat them like one, too.

4)	 Volume - Don’t be afraid of reaching out more than once and reminding 
people of the things they said they wanted. Doing them a service starts with 
communicating with them.

5)	 Execute - Actually do it. And build cultural norms around loving the process.

With that said, I hope you use this to grow your business and prosper. The next 
two-ish pages are my Lead Nurture Checklist you can tear off or use for reference.

Lead Nurture Checklist

ʶ	 Pillar I: Availability: The more availability you have, the higher the chance leads will 
schedule and show. 

ʶ	 Schedule appointments all seven days per week.
ʶ	 Schedule as many hours as you can manage. 9 am to 9 pm EST is a good goal.
ʶ	 Give more scheduling options. Four options per hour, or every 15 minutes, 

is a good goal. 
ʶ	 Add an automated self-scheduling process.
ʶ	 Remove as many steps as possible from the self-scheduling process. 

ʶ	 Pillar II: Speed: The faster you contact them, the more likely they’ll schedule and show, and 
the less work you’ll do.

ʶ	 Speed to first contact: Hire enough people to respond to leads in under 5 
minutes. (Extra Credit: do it in under 60 seconds).

ʶ	 Speed to first appointment: Book appointments same day, next day, or day 
after. 

ʶ	 Pull appointments forward whenever possible.
ʶ	 Outbound dial all leads that showed interest.
ʶ	 Speed of response: Respond to messages quickly. Doing some extra work 

during calendar gaps keeps leads warm. 
ʶ	 Pillar III: Personalization: The more you make it for them, the more likely they’ll show.

ʶ	 Use their preferred communication method: Contact them everywhere, and 
then focus your communication in the places they respond. 

ʶ	 Qualify leads: Use applications and demographic info so leads talk to the right 
people.

ʶ	 Segment messaging: Learn about the leads ahead of time from applications and 
publicly available info like social media accounts. Then, focus communication 
on stuff that’s relevant to them.

ʶ	 Send the best leads to the best closers.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 39



$100M Playbook: Lead Nurture

ʶ	 Incentivize showing up: give them a reason to show up. A/B incentives and 
gift card incentives work great.

ʶ	 Proof: show proof that matches their situation across all stages of follow-up.
ʶ	 Pillar IV: Volume: The more times you reach out to people, the more likely they’ll respond, 

schedule, and show.
ʶ	 Double-dial text 3x the first day. 
ʶ	 2x the second day and the day after.
ʶ	 1x 1–4 days after that 
ʶ	 Send automated reminders: 24 hours, 12 hours, 3 hours out. 

•	 Include the name, date, time, and the phone number or area code you’ll 
call from.

ʶ	 Manual reminders from a real phone: night before, morning of, 60 min prior.
ʶ	 Send multiple short messages rather than a big blocky message. It’s more 

natural. 
ʶ	 Keep the conversation going Acknowledge - Compliment - Ask the next 

question. Use this to qualify leads and pull appointments forward. 
ʶ	 BAMFAM: Book a meeting from a meeting. Never let a lead go to no-man’s 

land.
ʶ	 Execution: None of this will work unless you do. But if you do, this will work.

ʶ	 Track and rank: show rate, close rates, and lead-to-close ratio by sales rep.
ʶ	 Culture is everything. Normalize:
ʶ	 Make your team love “the boring work” that gets results.
ʶ	 “Yellows are the new gold”—don’t sleep on less qualified leads.
ʶ	 Volume negates luck—do more than everyone else.
ʶ	 Being garbage men—don’t judge a book by its cover. Be an equal opportunity 

salesman. Every lead is an opportunity for practice.
ʶ	 Process > All. No one is above the process. We all strive for that ideal.

That’s it. Now it’s on you.

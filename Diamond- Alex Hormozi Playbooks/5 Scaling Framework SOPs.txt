Read This First
Inside this document are five frameworks I use to scale our teams to $100

Million and beyond.

Each framework is minorly edited frommy original internal version that I use
to train my teams. Rather than make a “lead magnet” - I figured I’d give you
the frameworks the way I give them to my team so you could in turn, give

them to yours.

We have zillions of internal documents that we use to run departments. These
are among the most frequently used as our portfolio companies scale.

Here’s what they are and how they’ll help you scale.

Five Star Service Framework: As you scale a company, delivery is often one of
the first things to break. I give this framework to my customer support
representatives. It sets a standard for delivery. Our goal is to make delivery
better than it was when the company was smaller. It’s how - for example - our
average Net Promoter Score is 88. Which - for context - is above Chick Fil A -
58, and Apple - 61. If you have poor customer results scores - this is for you.

Sales-Customer Success Gametape Framework: As you scale your sales
and customer success departments, new faces come in, and details get lost.
Sometimes new managers do a poor job training - results on both sides
suffer. To combat this - we began using a weekly sales-CS gametape review.
This is where every week, both customer success and sales watch either a
sales call or an onboarding call together. This gives transparency to the work

both teams do. It allows both teams to create and maintain a seamless
customer experience as you scale. Once you start this, you’ll never go back.

High Performance Communication Framework: As you scale, you add more
teammates. More teammates means more communication. Communication
scaled poorly creates endless meetings, low morale, and plummeting team
effectiveness. The High Performance Communication Framework prevents
that. It focuses on increasing energy, engagement, and exploration - which
were found to be the three main ingredients for high performing teams. It
results in better communication, which results in higher quality and quantity
of work per teammate. This is a must as you scale.

Monday Hour One Framework: As you scale, every employee will be stretched
to capacity. Distraction comes next. To combat this, we use the Monday Hour
One Framework. It organizes everyone’s work. It increases the output of each
teammember as an individual and gives full transparency to their manager.
This allows managers to see exactly what everyone is working on, how
well-utilized their team is, who needs help, and how aligned everyone is…at a
glance. This allows us to hire effectively and divide work up as we add
headcount.

Pay Increase Framework: As you scale, the needs of your organization will
grow. And the skills of your employees will also (hopefully) grow. With an
increase in skill and responsibility, come increases in compensation. We give
this to all our teammates so they know what to expect, what we reward, and
how to ask for raises the right way. This gets everyone on the same page and
will make your teammore productive, avoid unnecessary drama, retain
teammates longer, and protect your bottom line. And avoid the mistakes of
overpaying or underpaying that both lead to losing great teammates.

With that being said, there’s a lot more to scaling a company than a small
booklet could ever hold. But, my hope is that these frameworks help you solve
key problems as you scale. They certainly have for me. Enjoy.

5 STAR SERVICE FRAMEWORK SOP

Why This Is Important

Something shocking that I did not know when I started in business is that
customers aremore likely to leave due to bad service than they are due to

price or product (study done by Mckinsey & Co)

Delivering high-quality customer service is crucial because it builds trust and
loyalty, sets us apart from competitors, and enhances our brand's reputation.

By showing customers that we care, listen, and resolve their issues quickly, we
create a positive experience that keeps them satisfied and encourages them

to stay with us and refer their friends.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



Ensuring every single interaction we have either strengthens or weakens our
brand.

This framework serves as a tool to use so you can ensure every ‘touch’ you
make with a customer is one that moves us forward, not backwards.

What It Is

Our customer service approach is built around five key standards. I use this
same framework with my own teams, take this - pass it on to yours and
brainstorm on how you can work together as a team to implement it.

1) Concern - We show concern for our customers’ well being, feelings, and
circumstances.

2) Courtesy -We treat customers with the utmost respect and
professionalism.

3) One&Done - We resolve their issue and any dependencies the first
time, every time. As I like to say ‘no leftovers’ in customer service.

4) Educate & Empower - We educate our customers on the ‘why’ and
empower them on what to do next time issues arise.

5) Timeliness - Customers have little patience (myself included). We want
them to be impressed, not just satisfied, with our speed.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



How To Do This

To evaluate the performance of Customer Service Representatives (CSRs),
use the five key standards as a framework to train your team on. Each

interaction can be assessed based on how well the representative meets
these standards once you have trained them on the following framework.

First, learn this framework and how to apply it tactically, then the next section
will cover how to measure if you’re tracking toward success or not.

★ Concern Star - Let our customers knowwe care
○ Thank the customer for reaching out & personalize the contact

■ “Hey John, thank you for reaching out to _____.”
○ Give Reassurance

■ “Not to worry I am more than happy to assist you in
resolving (issue) today!”

○ Verify the issue to ensure accuracy
■ “I understand you are struggling with (issue), is that

correct?”
○ At the end verify that a resolutionwas reached

■ “Today I assisted you with (issue) by helping you (steps
taken to reach resolution), by doing so was I able to fully
resolve your issues and questions you had today?”

★ Courtesy Star - Listen to our customers
○ Active Listening

■ Rephrase the customer response to ensure complete
understanding

● “So it sounds like you are upset because the
onboarding email stated you would receive a call
within 48 hours and that did not happen, is that

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



correct?”
■ Ask probing questions to find out the root issue

● “It looks like you used XXX email to sign up and then
XXX email to inquire with support, which email would
you like notifications to go to?”

● “Would you prefer to have the call rescheduled or
speak on the phone to determine a more fitting
course of action?

○ Personable conversation/Build rapport
■ Call the customer by their name
■ Ask the customer about their day
■ Use small talk and more casual language to build rapport

with the customer
○ Use a polite professional tone

■ Say please when asking for additional information
● “John, would you mind please sending me the email

you signed up with?”
■ Say thank you when information is provided

● “John, thank you so much for providing that
information”

■ Acknowledge when they give you gratitude
● “I really appreciate that feedback, that means a lot to

know”

★ Educate and Empower - Utilize all resources to educate and empower our
customers

○ Answer the customer
■ Give them what they want, a solution or answer, first and

foremost
● “Hi John! Here is the phone number and email you

signed up with.”

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



○ Educate on how you solved the problemor found the solution
■ Show the customer where and how you found the answer

you are giving them
● “To make it easy for next time, HERE is a link that

shows where you can find this next time, so you don’t
have to wait for me!”

○ Empower the customer going forward

■ Teach/Explain to the customer what caused the issue and
show them how to avoid it in the future

● “Just so you know the reason this was not sent to
your email is because you input this alternative email
into the second intake form. If you want to keep using
the email I'm corresponding with now you can go
ahead and use that one to sign up for webinars so it
sends emails there! :)”

★ One&Done - Resolve the issue the first time and prevent recurrences
○ Verify the issuewas resolved

■ Summarize the steps taken to resolve the issue and ensure
the same issue will not repeat itself

● “Thanks for your patience John! To summarize, we
have replaced the email you get notifications to with
this one so that all notifications go here, to prevent
this from occurring again I will delete the other email
from our database”

○ Educate the customer
■ “If this happens again, you can either inquire with me again

or go HERE to update the email.”
○ Offer additional assistance

■ Before wrapping up be sure that there isn’t any other
questions or other issues that they would like assistance

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



with
● “This is all taken care of, John. Is there anything else I

can do to help you today?”

★ Timeliness - Interact and resolve issues as soon as possible

○ Respond to the inquiry immediately even if you cannot respond
within thatmoment

■ “Morning John! I will be with you in two moments so I can
ensure you have my undivided attention”

○ Resolve that issue before you open another

■ We want to ensure our undivided attention to each inquiry
at a time to ensure proper resolution and a timely one!

How ToGrade Each Rep

If you simply deploy this without measuring its effectiveness, you will fail. In
order to know if you are upholding these standards you’re going to have to

ask your customers. The easiest way is to send the following survey to
customers after each interaction. It is a total of 5 questions and they will rate

on a scale of 1-5, so it should only take 60 seconds if not less to fill out. I
suggest plugging this into your email follow up, CRM, CS platform, or whatever

platform you use to build automations (I’m not the expert here)

Concern:

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



● Question: Did the representative demonstrate empathy and genuine
care for your needs? Did they acknowledge your feelings and show
understanding of the issue?

○ Grading: Rate from 1 to 5 based on how well the customer service
rep showed concern and empathy.

Courtesy:

● Question:Was the representative polite, respectful, and professional
throughout the interaction? Did they listen actively?

○ Grading: Rate from 1 to 5 based on politeness, professionalism,
and active listening.

Educate & Empower:

● Question: Did the representative provide accurate, helpful information
and guidance? Did they use available resources to empower you with
knowledge or solutions?

○ Grading: Rate from 1 to 5 based on the quality of information
shared and the representative's ability to empower you to make
an informed decision.

One&Done:

● Criteria:Was your issue resolved in a single interaction, or was further
follow-up needed? Did the representative take the necessary steps to
solve the problem completely?

○ Grading: Rate from 1 to 5 based on how effectively the CSR
resolved the issue in the first contact.

Timeliness:

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



● Criteria: How quickly was your issue resolved? Was the resolution
completed within the expected timeframe ?

○ Grading: Rate from 1 to 5 based on the speed of resolution.

Five Star Service:

● Criteria: Overall, did the representative deliver a five-star experience?
Were all aspects of the service — concern, courtesy, knowledge,
efficiency, and timeliness — executed to the highest standard?

○ Grading: Provide an overall rating from 1 to 5 based on the
combined performance across all the standards.

GAMETAPE REVIEW FRAMEWORK SOP

Why is this important?

This is one of themost beneficial calls that you can implement in a company. I can
speak from firsthand experience, implementing this call has completely turned

around the marketing, sales, and customer success departments in multiple portfolio
companies of mine. I can’t speak highly enough of how insane the results are if this is

done right.

Most departments operate in silos. That’s tough when your customer does not. If the
teams who interact with your customer are not aligned on what the customer

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



journey looks like, then you will inevitably be leaving money on the table or even
actively burning it.

As the CEO of a $500 million portfolio, I still attend these calls. If I ever see an issue in
my marketing department, sales department, customer success department my go
to is to sit on these calls until I have pinpointed where the problem lies. Oftentimes
the reason we don’t get what we want in business is not because the individual

department is not functioning well but because they don’t function well together as
a team. They function in silos and therefore create a disjointed experience for the

customer that has people wanting to leave.

This call helps marketing understand customer wants, needs, objections even more
then they would hear it from sales.

Things they can leverage when writing
ads/content. Overcoming objections before they even hit a sales call.

This helps sales recognize what they can do better in terms of presenting on the call,
and shore up expectations if any are not properly set and you’re seeing bad churn.

This helps product and delivery understand what features, benefits, and add we can
build into the product. This helps us clearly define what

features/services are necessary for a base level product as well as what are possible
up-sells, add ons & expansion revenue opportunities.

What is it?

This is a meeting where you bring in stakeholders from the Marketing, Sales,
Customer Success departments to observe a sales or delivery call.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



Each person has a different objective of what they are looking for when watching the
call and will take note as directed below. It is probably one of the highest ROI

meetings you can implement into your company.

How to DoGametape Review

1. ARRANGE
a. You will implement a recurring weekly meeting on your calendar that

will last 60-90 minutes to facilitate the Gametape Review
b. Host: Head of Sales
c. Attendees: Head of Marketing, Sales, Customer Success

i. If your team is larger, you can include additional teammates
such as managers or “leads”

ii. If one specific team is struggling, I will add more people from that
team to this call so that we can train them quickly.

iii. there are no rules, add whoever you think this will help.
2. ASSEMBLE

a. 1 Day prior to the meeting each week the Head of Sales will ask for
either…

b. Sales call
c. Onboarding Call
d. Service call

i. This is the call that will be reviewed during the meeting the
following day.

ii. If there's nothing going wrong in any of these departments, then I
would suggest rotating calls in such order. However, if you have
an issue in any single department, I would spend 4 weeks
sequentially only reviewing calls from the department with the
constraint.

3. ASSESS
a. The appropriate parties will hop on the call ready to take notes and

watch the call together at 1.5x speed

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



b. The host will share their screen and play the call at 1.5x speed.
c. Each stakeholder has a different objective they are watching for…

i. Sales Leader:
1. What went right?
2. What should we improve?

ii. Marketing Leader:
1. What objections could I overcome ahead of the call in our

marketing?
2. What objections cannot be overcome in marketing that

sales should train on?
iii. Customer Success Leader:

1. What was said here that I can ensure gets handed off to
the delivery team?

2. What was said here that we cannot deliver on and
therefore sales should update their script?

4. ANALYZE
a. At the end of the call, all parties will share their feedback with each

other and determine what ONE thing we can commit to acting upon.
b. This is important because you will see a lot of things wrong. However,

my strong suggestion is that you pick the one thing that is the “big
domino” because if you pick too many things at once, even if they are
objectively better, you might mess stuff up because your team doesn’t
have the bandwidth to see out all the changes with great execution.

5. ACT
a. Document the action item and key points.
b. Monitor progress and adjust in future reviews.

HIGH PERFORMANCECOMMUNICATION
FRAMEWORK SOP

Why is this important?

The question is always there but never said.Why is it that some teams and
teammates exceed expectations constantly, while others struggle to meet
the minimum requirements? Interestingly enough, I have concluded that this
is revolving around their communication habits. Think about it, if someone is a
terrible communicator (nonresponsive, slow, short, vague) that is how you
label them, you cannot even see past their horrific communication skills to

see if they are a high performer.

And if they are, it's unlikely you care so much because their communication is
detrimental to the team.

Communication is the end all, be all. Good communication is the bridge
between confusion and clarity. And if you leave people around you constantly
feeling confused, odds are you are not their favorite person and even more

they probably avoid you.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



Actually, can you even think of a time you were confused and it was NOT due
to improper communication? *I cannot*

Secondary to being a horrible communicator, then there are those who just
simply do not communicate. I mean, they do, but only when it's absolutely

necessary. Aside from that, you would not even know they were on the team
because they don’t make a peep.

These people are often the shining stars of the company but you would never
know because they lack confidence, are shy, or would never dare boast or

speak highly of themselves. This is not any better than leaving people
confused. Instead of leaving people confused, they just simply do not address

you because of fear of creating discomfort or anxiety.

There was a study I read about done at MIT where they looked across a wide
range of industries to find workplaces that had similar teams with varying
performance. The research included innovation teams, post -op wards in

hospitals, customer facing teams in banks, backroom operations, and many
others. They asked the members of those teams to wear electronic badges.
Those badges collected data on their individual communication behavior -
tone of voice, body language, whom they talked to how many times, etc…

Across the board, the data confirmed that communication played the most
critical role in building a successful team. They actually identified specific

patterns of communication to be the most important predictors of success.

Communication itself was a greater predictor of success than individual
intelligence or skill level of the team.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



It turns out, the two best predictors of this were the team's energy and
engagement with each other outside of formal meetings. Together those two
factors explained 40% of the variance in dollar productivity among groups.

What is it?

Most books, courses, and articles vaguely describe what good
communication is. Over the years one of the things that has irritated me the
most is the fact that everyone preaches ‘You gotta communicate’ but then
they fail to define what that means or how to do it, tactically. Below is my

framework that I have found skyrockets communication, collaboration and
therefore - business growth.

Energy: The number and nature of interactions among teammembers,
regardless of if they are verbal or nonverbal. (#1 video conference, #1 text)

Engagement: The distribution of energy among teammembers. In a simple
three-person team, engagement is a function of the average amount of
energy between A and B, A and C, and B and . The more members of the team
that speak up during a decision making process, the more
profitable/successful the decision ends up to be. Yes, this means the more
YOU speak up, the smarter your team as a whole becomes.

Exploration: This is communication that teammates engage in outside of
their core team (other teams). There is a correlation between high performing
teams and collaboration with other teammates and departments. The reason
this is the ‘multiplier’ is because once you nail energy and engagement, you
want to ‘explore’ aka MULTIPLY the good communication that has been built.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



How to Use The Framework

1. Energy: How to Improve It

● Become a Fast Communicator:

○ Slow communicators are notorious for worsening teams, the

speed of communication has the closest correlation to energy.

Think about it, who has more energy, someone who runs slowly or

quickly? Think about great communicators, do you wait days for

them to respond? I think not.

● If You See Something Say Something:

○ A special practice I engage with each day is I have a block at my

EOD on my calendar labeled ‘praise’ in which I just reach out to

anyone who I noticed do something cool, difficult, or impressive

that day. I send them a message before I go to bed. I live by the

saying, never let a good gesture go unnoticed.

● Vary HowYouCommunicate:

○ If you study the best communicators, they don’t have one way

they communicate. They often are the teammates you blow up

the zoom chat on calls, slack you, send you gifts, comment on

your social media posts. When i’m trying to increase the energy of

communication I encourage people to use different mediums to

‘react’ to their teammates, even if it's a simple emoji.

2. Engagement: How to Improve It

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



● Pull OnMeetings:

○ If you’re the boss or even an ambitious peer, chatting teammates

privately on calls who don’t speak up as much and encouraging

them to do so - then praise them when they do. Whenever I am

training someone to be a leader or better communicator I use the

private chat feature to feed them lines to say to the group, until

they are comfortable doing so themselves.

○ Have each member of the team responsible for one piece of

presenting on the teammeeting - this way you create a process

for even distribution of talk time and engagement. This also helps

teammates increase their public speaking capabilities.

● Buddy Up:

○ When I have two teammates who don’t interact much, I try to

strategically place them on projects together. Not only because I

will improve communication but because I also know that the

more the team communicates, the less they need me!

3. Exploration: How To Improve It

● Collaborate Across Teams:

○ Set up cross-team projects or “special projects” where people

from different departments work together. Do you NEED to have 2

departments working on it? Maybe not, but you WILL benefit from

it, and so will they.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



○ Have teammembers join projects or groups outside their usual

role to gain new insights, ideas, and collaboration. I will ask

teammates from our media team to join portfolio calls once a

month to ensure they see what goes on in other departments on

our team and we keep communication flowing.

● Casual Events

○ My teams like hanging out with each other but seldom do we find

all of ourselves in a room. Something that's worked really well is

hosting monthly game nights, pizza parties, or luncheons so that

all the teams across the board get to spend time with each other.

○ As an aside, I do have once a year full teammeetups to facilitate

this as well where I purposely mix up seating arrangements and

activities so for 2 days nobody interacts with their typical team!

How To Deploy This

1. Share This with your team: Share this document with your leaders and

ask them to grade their teams on each area

a. How would you grade your team on ENERGY on a scale of 1-10?

b. How would you grade your team on ENGAGEMENT on a scale of 1-10?

c. How would you grade your team on EXPLORATION on a scale of 1-10?

2. Ask your team: Ask your team to ask how THEY want to take action. You

don’t need to come up with all the ideas on your own. Give them this

document, have them grade their team and ask them to reflect on

what they want to focus on to improve their ‘worst’ area of

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



communication. I find that it's best to focus on ONE area, no matter ‘how

bad’ or far off you may be.

MONDAYHOURONE FRAMEWORK SOP

Why is this important?

This provides transparency for management to ensure no one person is
overloaded or underloaded, and we can properly disperse work amongst

teams, and project deadlines more easily.

What isMonday Hour One?

It is ONE hour (usually less) of planning that saves you 10-12 hours the rest of
the week on average. During this hour, you will pre-plan your working hours
for the rest of the week to ensure you complete all tasks, projects, and also

accommodate for any unexpected items. Some people call this
time-blocking.

What is Expected?

Each week after you complete this Monday morning (or over the weekend)
your Supervisor should be able to look at your calendar and see all of your

time blocked and properly allocated.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



How To DeployMonday Hour One

1. The Look Back: Review the previous week’s calendar, what did you not

get done? What is unresolved?

a. Review all your sent emails, what is not followed up on or

complete?

b. What happened last week on my calendar that I need to pull

forward to this week?

c. Review communication platform, anything you missed or forgot

to respond to?

d. Review ‘constraints’ from last week.

i. What process/communication/document can be put in

place to prevent that constraint from happening again in

the future?

2. The Look Forward: Review the next 1-3 months calendar, what do you

need to start working on? What should you ‘pull’ forward this week to

ensure you hit your targets?

a. Review your project management tool - what projects are

upcoming that you need to start working on?

b. Review the next month on your calendar, what is up and coming

you may need to start preparing for? What about your quarterly

goals?

c. Review your EOW reports (yours or your reports if applicable)

what steps need to be taken?

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



3. Prioritize the items you have just written down.

a. What is the most important that will move you/your team/the

business forward the most? Those should be scheduled as

priorities. We do not schedule priorities around our other stuff, we

schedule other stuff around our priorities.

4. Schedule Your Priorities!

a. Schedule in your projects/tasks/work blocks for your priorities

b. Delete or move anything that does not revolve around these to

the best of your ability

c. Be realistic - Insert your lunch time, as well as any breaks you

may take daily to pick/drop kids off at school and/or take a stroll

to clear your head.

d. These should be as detailed as possible. There is no “project work”

block, it must be named specific to the name of the project you

are working on.

e. Start by inserting the high priority projects, and then follow that

with scheduling time to check email, project management tool,

facebook, and any other small tasks that must be done multiple

times throughout the day.

5. Schedule in OVERFLOW/AD-HOC time.

a. We can only be so good at guessing how long things will take us,

however you would be surprised that if we put constraints on our

time, we can typically get items done in much less time than if we

give ourselves too much time.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



b. This time is also set apart for ‘Ad Hoc Requests’ if your job entails

you may get those on a daily basis, whether its urgent customer

requests, follow ups, or items urgently requested by peers or

managers.

6. Color Code Your Calendar

a. This is extremely helpful because it gives an easy to measure way

of seeing where your time is spent.

b. Here is a basic color code:

i. Recurring Meetings: Blue

ii. Admin Tasks: Red

iii. One off Meetings: Yellow

iv. Project/Priorities: Green

v. Break/Food Time: Purple

vi. Personal Events/Time (If you choose to input): Orange

PAY INCREASE FRAMEWORK SOP

Why is this important?

Many companies don’t have a philosophy around how to pay people or how
to give raises.

This ends up biting you in the butt as you grow because you lose good people
either due to overpaying the bad people or under paying the good ones.

Not to mention, having no standard way in which you explain how you pay,
which then leads to unfair and unequal pay.

I wish I understood my company is that people talk. They talk and they share
what they get paidmore than you would ever guess. And so you want to be
as transparent as possible and why people do that no matter what is not an

area of contention.

This is something that you want to do before you grow, and if you haven’t until
now - this is one you can’t implement too soon.

© 2024, by Acquisition.com LLC



What is the Pay Increase Framework?

This is a guide meant to give you an outline for how to do hay increases, but
also one that you can hand to your team when they join and show them so

that they know what to expect.

I’m a big fan of transparent pay policies and this is one of those. This

The Key to Earning a Raise: Demonstrating Excellence

The single most important factor in earning a raise is demonstrating
consistent excellence in your work. High performers are rewarded the fastest.
This principle supersedes all other considerations. If you excel, the
opportunities for financial growth will naturally follow.

What to Expect as an Amount for Your Raise:

Leadership in collaboration with Human Resources will evaluate the employee's
performance and assign them to one of the four categories:

● Standard Performance/NotMeeting Criteria: Regular performance without
any exceptional results. (1-3%)

● Consistent Performance and Reliability: Consistently meets expectations and
is a reliable contributor. (4-5%)

● Excellence/High Performance/Added Responsibilities: Consistently exceeds
expectations, takes on extra responsibilities. (5-10%)

● Promotion toManagement/New Skills/Significant Increase in
Responsibilities: Recently promoted or has acquired new skills or taken on
significant new duties. (10-20%)

Once the employee is assigned to a category that is how we dictate their pay
increase.

CommonCircumstances That Lead to a Bigger Raise:

1. Significant Increase in Responsibilities: When there is a substantial
change in your role, significant increase in teammates, taking on new
tasks that are formally documented (e.g., changes to a JD document),
this often warrants a raise.

2. Promotion toManagement or Leadership: Moving into a management
position or taking on a leadership role by overseeing a team can justify
a salary increase.

3. Consistent Performance and Achievement: Continual hard work and
consistent achievement, especially when it leads to taking on tasks
beyond the original scope of your job, is a strong case for requesting a
raise. We don’t reward fantastic individual contributors any less than
leaders - both are crucial to company performance.

Frequency and Percentage of Raises:

We do not grant raises based on any predetermined schedule, nor are raises
distributed equally across the company or within departments. Instead, raises

are evaluated on an individual, case-by-case basis, reflecting each
employee's unique contributions and performance.

However, as a general rule, unless there is a special circumstance (such as a
promotion), raises are typically not awarded more than once within a

calendar year.

How to Get/Ask for a Raise

1. Understand Your Value andMarket Rate:

● Research Your Position's Market Value: Start by gathering data on the
average salary or hourly rate for your job title in your region, considering
factors like your level of experience, industry standards, and cost of
living. Websites like Glassdoor, Payscale, and the Bureau of Labor
Statistics can provide useful benchmarks.

● Assess Your Unique Contributions: Identify and quantify your
contributions to the company, such as completed projects, revenue
generated, cost savings, or process improvements. Understanding your
value will help justify your request. We want to lead with data, not
emotions.

2. Determine the Appropriate Increase:

● KnowWhat Percentage to Ask For: Make sure your request is realistic
and backed by data and works within the Pay Raise Framework we use
internally

● Be Readywith Specific Numbers: For example, "Based on my research
and contributions, I would like to request an increase of $5,000 to
$7,000."

3. Prepare for the Conversation:

● Approach Professionally andCalmly: Avoid making emotional appeals
or putting your supervisor on the defensive. Start the conversation with
a positive note about your satisfaction with your job and how much you
enjoy your work.

● Sample Opening Lines:
○ "I really enjoy working here and find my projects very challenging.

Over the past year, I've noticed the scope of my work has

expanded significantly, and my roles and responsibilities, along
with my contributions, have increased. I would like to discuss the
possibility of reviewing my compensation."

○ "I’d like to talk about my career and how I can continue doing my
best work for the company."

4. Present a Strong Case:

● Be Specific and Evidence-Based: Clearly outline why you deserve a
raise, using examples and metrics to demonstrate your increased
responsibilities and contributions, lead with evidence not emotions and
use the provided framework.

● Have Supporting Documentation Ready: Be prepared to share data
that supports your request, such as industry salary reports or a list of
your achievements and how they align with company goals. You can
use payscale.com or salary.com to gather this information. The best
pay increase requests i have seen the employee has put together a
slide deck presentation.

5. Practice Patience and Professionalism:

● Give YourManager Time: Recognize that salary decisions require
careful consideration, reviews, and possibly discussions with upper
management. Don’t expect an immediate response.

● Remain Calmand Patient: Avoid following up too frequently. Typically,
it's acceptable to discuss salary once a year unless there are
exceptional circumstances or promotion opportunities.

6. Avoid Over-Asking:

● Limit Frequency of Requests: Asking for a raise too often can appear as
though you are dissatisfied or constantly seeking more compensation
rather than being committed to your role. Annual reviews are usually

the standard unless you have received a promotion or your
responsibilities have changed dramatically.

7. Follow Up Respectfully:

● After the conversation, send a polite email thanking your manager for
their time and reiterating your commitment to your role and the
company, while also gently reminding them of your request.

TYING IT ALTOGETHER

If it feels like this is a lot. I agree - it is.

As a 4x Founder and the CEO of a portfolio of businesses, I see it everyday. The
job of the Founder/CEO is grueling. There is never ending work and limited

time.

The goal of these 5 Frameworks is to save you a little time and a lot of pain so
you don’t have to build these out yourself or make the same mistakes I did

when I was scaling fast for the first time a decade ago.

If you’re a business owner looking to scale … I host Scaling Workshops at my
Headquarters in Las Vegas monthly. There are usually 50-75 businesses (100
people in total) at these workshops. The team that runs my $500M Portfolio
runs these workshops hence the limited space and frequency. So if you want
more hands-on help than these Frameworks, go ahead and sign up for a call

at the link here and we will hop on and let you know if you qualify.

And if not - I'm still rooting for you as one of the few brave ones trying to make
a difference in this world.

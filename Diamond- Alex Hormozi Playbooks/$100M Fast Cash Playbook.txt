Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity. Cash is reality.

April 2019.
“Yo, something’s up. Gym launch cancellations have started flying in.” My director of 

Customer Success said.
“What’s going on?” I shot back.  
“A bunch of gyms got hit with unexpected tax bills.”
“...uh since when are taxes unexpected?”
“They’ve never made this much money before. So they never really had to pay much. 

But a lot of them moved up a few brackets from using Gym Launch”
“OK, so where’s the money they made?”
“Most of them say they spent it all… and I believe them.”
“Wait. So they’re happy with Gym Launch, they just don’t have the money to pay us and 

the tax man.”
“Pretty much sums it up.”
“Okay. You think if we give them a way to make the cash to pay the tax man by next 

week they’ll stay on with us?”
“Definitely. But…how are we gonna do that?”
“I have an idea for a grand opening promo but now seems like as good of a time as any. 

I first saw it as a giveaway, but I think we could easily make it a high ticket offer. Looking 
at most of their numbers, I think they’ll get  5-10 people at $5,000 a pop. That should help 
with their tax bills. You’ve talked to them, think it’ll be enough?”

“I think so yeah, but I see one wrinkle…a lot of them haven’t sold anything 
expensive before?”

“Got it. I’ll include specific sales training for this offer. I think that’ll just make it sweeter 
for the people on the fence about quitting anyway.”

“Well, that is juicy. I think we can make that work. What’ll it include.”

“For now, just make sure they don’t have any training sessions on Sundays. We’ll have 
them put all the high ticket clients then.

“Perfect…” he paused, “One last problem. They don’t have any way to market this to 
their members.”

“I’ll write the promotional materials after we get off the phone. Schedule a big call for 
tomorrow. I’ll have everything ready by then. Let them know they start it the same day they 
get it, they should have their cash in a few days at the latest.”

“Sounds good”
“Oh, one more thing. Make sure to invite all the people that have recently canceled. I 

think some of them will have a change of heart after the call…”   
“This is insane. I love it.”

A few days later…
“How’s it going?” I prodded. 
“Dude. It’s CRUSHING.”
“Gimme some stats.”
“The average business collected an extra $30,000 in cash.”
“So they sold only 6?”
“Nah, a lot of them chickened out and sold it for $3000 But the few who did $5000 all 

raked in $50k or more.”
“So they’re good. We’re covered. They still in?”
“Yep, they all renewed and are back in good standing.”
“Great. Nice when stuff works as advertised eh? If any have cash left over, offer them 

to prepay the rest of the year. Better they invest in their business than blow their money on 
some stupid exercise machine no one in their gym cares about.”

“On it. By the way, should I just save this for when a gym needs cash?”
“When does a business not need cash?”
“Roger that. I’ll add it to the playbooks.”

I learned just as much about business helping other gyms grow as I did growing my 
own. And one important lesson has stood the test of time: Revenue is vanity. Profit is sanity. 
Cash is reality. As long as you’ve got cash, you’re still in business. You can make it through all 
kinds of mess ups if you’ve got cash. And you can have the best business in the world, but if 
you’ve got no cash, your days are numbered. 

For that reason, it would follow to have lots of ways to generate lots of cash, really fast. 
And that’s exactly what I’m gonna show you how to do. By the way, if you execute only this 
playbook…you will more than ROI any investment you put into them. That’s a promise. 

Let’s make some money.

Fast Cash Plays - What/How/Why
A quick nickel beats a slow dime when you know how to use it. 

What Fast Cash Plays Are

Every business owner benefits from having a few fast cash plays in their back pocket. 
Fast Cash Plays are limited time offers advertised to your warmest audiences. Your warmest 
audiences include current customers, previous customers, and all engaged leads–all people 
who’ve given you explicit permission to contact them about the stuff you sell. 

To be clear, fast cash plays are different from nurturing new leads about your main offer. 
And it’s also different from the ‘long term’ value-adds, like content emails, you use to keep 
your lists warm. 

Fast Cash Plays are more like winning lottery tickets you cash in once a quarter. This 
means you run a specific promotion to your existing customers four times a year. To be clear, 
this is on top of whatever else they’re paying for. And, in case you’re curious, no, your cus-
tomers won’t mind… at least if you do it the way I show you anyway.

How Fast Cash Plays Work

Fast Cash Plays are specifically designed to make the most money, in the shortest period 
possible, from the people most likely to buy it. For most businesses, this means their existing 
customers. Fast Cash plays are limited in spots (scarcity), high touch (exclusivity), and sold 
for lots of money (big ticket), for a limited time (urgency).

They create tremendous profit for two reasons. First, you’ve already acquired the leads 
you advertise to -  so there’s no additional cost to make the sale. Second, bigger price tags 
tend to have much better margins.

Think about it like this. If you only have a single fixed-price offer, you cap how much 
any customer can spend. By making other offers available, you allow people who want to 
spend money on your business to actually do it. And when they do, you’ll make a lot more 
money. But again, this only happens if you have stuff for them to buy. They can afford it…I’ll 
prove it to you.

Fast Cash Plays - What/How/Why

Let me tell you something that blew my mind: 1 out of 9 Americans is a millionaire. So 
it’s not as uncommon as you think. Despite what social media would have you believe, most 
rich people don’t walk around with signs on their heads that say, “I have money.” With that 
said, they can definitely afford to buy more stuff so long as you provide the value to back it 
up. And I thought to myself… “How do I get these people to give me some of their mon-
ey?”…this gave birth to the 10x the 10% rule.

10x The 10%: If you get 10% of your customers to pay 10x the price…you double your 
revenue. Not only that, since you already spent the money to get the customer…all the extra 
revenue (minus delivery) drops straight to the bottom line. Meaning, sometimes you can 2x, 
3x, or even 4x revenue, just by getting one customer out of ten to buy a more expensive thing! 

Business owners forget how fast ultra premium prices add up to mountains of cash. 
Or, they’re just scaredy cats. Worst case - you just don’t sell that many. Fine - you still make 
money. Who cares? You can just keep living your life. You’re no worse off. 

Now, if you want to have a big spending offer, then you want to get the attention of the 
big spending group. And to get the attention of the big-spending group we limit the number 
of buyers. So, price like you mean it. We’ll get into the details of that a little later. For now, 
just know if one out of ten customers buys something for 10x the price…you double your 
revenue :).

Fast Cash Plays - What/How/Why

Why Fast Cash Plays Matter
Broken equipment. Leaky pipes. New tech. Cyber attacks. Legal fees, or simply an extra 

pay period in a thirty-day window.  I’ve had ‘em all. And, I never expected them. You real-
ly never know when you’re gonna need some extra cash. Over time, I realized something I 
should always expect is an unexpected cash drain. I don’t know where it’ll come from…but it 
will come. So, plays like this in your back pocket come in handy. I can’t tell you how many 
times they have been for me. Every entrepreneur could use a few more ‘get out of jail free’ 
cards - this gives you plenty.

One last thing before we move on. The only thing better than making extra cash when 
you need it, is making even more when you don’t. Planning these Cash Plays can be one 
of the most profitable things you ever do. In the early days, despite Cash Plays only being 
~15% of my annual revenue, they were nearly half my profit. This means doing the Fast Cash 
Plays doubled my take home income. Well worth it. And that was before I got good at ‘em.

Fast Cash Play Outline

There are lots of promotions you can run to your existing customers: Reactivation Plays. 
Referral Plays. Easy Cash Plays. And over our time together, I’ll break em all down. For now, 
we’ll start with the one that makes you the most money the fastest: Fast Cash. 

To be clear - this playbook won’t make you a billionaire. But, it can probably buy you a 
nice car in a week or two for the meager price of a few emails, texts, and posts. 

I’ll walk you through the fast cash play using my preferred setup:
ʶ	 A description of how it works.
ʶ	 A few examples of Fast Cash Plays in different industries. Think of how you could use 

the play in your business. 
ʶ	 Important Notes and tactics that make it work. These tidbits help you execute the play 

- like it’s your hundredth time doing it - on your first try. 
ʶ	 A summary. All the important points about how to do it. Plus, some extra thoughts 

sprinkled in about how to make Fast Cash Plays more profitable.

Onwards.

T﻿he Fast Cash Playbook
People who say following instructions are overrated…never have.

By the end of this playbook you’ll know exactly how to make Fast Cash Plays work for 
you. And to be clear, this works for both business-to-business offers and business-to-con-
sumer offers. I’ll cover who you advertise your offer to, what you sell, what to charge, how 
many to sell, how you sell it, how to price it, two different layouts on how to advertise it de-
pending on how you sell, and finally important points that make this work, then a summary 
to wrap this all up. Let’s start with who you advertise your Fast Cash offer to.

Description

Who to advertise to. You advertise your Fast Cash offer to your existing customers, pre-
vious customers, and engaged leads list. We focus on these groups because: 1) They’re most 
likely to buy 2) They’re the lowest cost to advertise to, often free. This means you don’t need 
to do as much advertising or selling. This dramatically shortens the ‘letting them know’ and 
‘getting them to buy’ process. And by making this a limited offer, you can do this multiple 
times per year without fatiguing your warm audience. They’re ready to buy, we just need to 
let them.  

What to sell them. With Fast Cash offers, you want to think scarcity, urgency, exclusivity, 
and a premium price. So think of all the most valuable things you can do that are “unscal-
able.” Things like:

ʶ	 Attention: 1 on 1 attention from you, or senior persons in the company
ű	 Many on 1 attention. This is where a team of people supports one customer. 

With a top expert, this is even more valuable than 1 on 1.
ʶ	 Personalization: Personalized, customized versions of your standard solutions.
ʶ	 Convenience: 24/7 support, extended hours, exclusive times, etc.
ʶ	 Status: Special parking, perks, badges, public recognition.
ʶ	 Duration: Longer duration than standard solutions. Think six months to a year.
ʶ	 Speed: First in line. Priority. Fast response time promises (<10 min or less)
ʶ	 Experience:  Think “White Glove” service. Personal cell phone access. A concierge 

line. Nice dinners. Nice drinks. Gifts.

“Secret menu” “Black book.”
You will want to have one to three core components of your offer, and three bonuses. 

Main reason: we’ll layer in these bonuses one at a time to increase the likelihood people buy 
with each additional bonus. We give them new information to further expand the price-to-
value discrepancy to push them over the edge. You’ll make all the bonuses available to all 
buyers, no matter when they buy. If someone buys early in the sequence, the bonuses simply 
further confirm they made the right choice.

How many to sell. With a Fast Cash Play, we want to cap how many people can buy it. 
At first, I suggest capping it to a number where you will absolutely sell out– maybe five to ten 
percent of your customers. If you only have a handful of customers then you already do lots 
of the above stuff as your typical offer. So this means you can appeal to all of them privately 
and personally– expecting a few of them to bite. For example, if you had 100 customers, 
you’d limit it to 5-10. If you have 1000 or more, then fulfillment may constrain you well 
before the 5-10% window. Fine. It just means you’ll figure out how to do it better by the 
next run. The point is - you want to sell out fast. This makes your Fast Cash offer even more 
compelling the next time you make it…selling out even faster.

How to sell it. For most businesses, high price points deserve a one-on-one consulta-
tion. If you can’t because you have a ton of customers, or a very big brand that allows you 
to sell more expensive stuff without a consult…then do what you already know works. Just 
know that the more personal you make the sale of a personal product the more bites you’ll 
get. 

How you sell matters because it changes how you promote:
 If you blast your whole list and have an automated checkout. Build up tension (launch 

style– see $100M Leads), cause a stampede by opening the cart to everyone at once, and 
making it first come, first serve. 

If you do consultations. Unless you have enough competent salespeople, you’ll struggle to 
smash all consultations together. To fix this, make your thing available for purchase day one, 
but drive people to book appointments. This way you can spread out the consults and see ev-
eryone, even with a limited sales staff (which is sometimes just you). Limited spots and first 
come, first serve rules still apply.

The Fast Cash Playbook

If you aren’t too tech savvy but have cards on file, then instructions to simply reply to 
you’re offer that they’re “in” will do just fine. Then, with their permission you can charge 
their card, book their appointment, or both. And if you don’t have their card on file, then 
just call them up to collect their card immediately after they respond. 

What to charge. A lot. Take whatever your average cart value - or transaction size is, and 
add a zero. And if you want to get frisky, multiply it by five. So yes, think 10x to 50x your 
current price tag. And yes, the point is to go beyond comparison to your other products. 
And yes, you do these to select for the people with the purchasing power to get it. The only 
thing that should shock them as much as the price is the value that goes with it. To be clear– You. 
Will. Work. More. For. These. Customers. You will earn that money. Personally, I like work-
ing for money, so Fast Cash Plays work well with my preferences to go big.  

Promoting It. Promote your Fash Cash play for seven days or less or until spots run out. 
I’ll give examples of both CTA to consult and CTA to an automated checkout below. I sep-
arated each with a line to make them easier to differentiate. 

PUSH TO CONSULT SEQUENCE

ʶ	 7 DAYS OUT - Let them know something big is coming via email tomorrow. I prefer 
to do this with texts. That’s it.

ʶ	 6 DAYS OUT - Announcement email. List the one to three core components of your 
offer. If you suck at sales or have a hot list, include a price range:  ‘four-figure invest-
ment,’ ‘must be willing to invest at least $2000,’ or compare to your current prices ‘costs 
more than a year of service.’

ű	 Text them to draw attention to the email.
ű	 Have a CTA in that email for them to schedule a consult.

ʶ	 5 DAYS OUT - Recap offer. Just send bullets of everything you sent the day before for 
people who missed it. Add your first additional bonus if you have it (Ex= Status Bonus - 
better parking).

ʶ	 3 DAYS OUT - Sales update. Let everyone know how many sold already,  how many 
you have left, and remind them it’s first come first serve. Then, again remind them of 
good stuff it helps them get, bad stuff it helps them avoid.

ű	 Send text reminder with CTA to reply.

The Fast Cash Playbook

ʶ	 2 DAYS - X Spots Left. Let them know spots are running out. Add your second bonus 
if you have it. (Ex=Secret bonus - special training). And make sure to explain the benefits.

ű	 Send text reminder with CTA to reply.
ʶ	 24 HOURS OUT (AM) - Warning: A few hours out or X spots left.  Add your best 

bonus here. This should be worth more than the entire price tag and should get you to 
sell out if you haven’t already. (Ex = Access - In-Person two-day retreat at a luxury location).

ű	 Send text reminder with CTA to reply.
ʶ	 12 HOURS OUT (PM) - Sold out. 

ű	 Send a text letting them know.
ʶ	 (Optional) Back out one spot left. If you have someone back out.

ű	 Send text.

PUSH TO AUTOMATED CHECKOUT SEQUENCE

ʶ	 5 DAYS OUT - Primer Text: Let them know something big is coming via email tomor-
row. That’s it.

ʶ	 4 DAYS OUT - Announcement email. Say the one to three core components of your 
offer. Include price if you suck at sales and have a hot list. Give a price range in ‘figures’ 
aka - ‘four-figure investment’ or ‘must be willing to invest at least $2000.’ 

ű	 Text to draw attention to the email.
ʶ	 2 DAYS OUT - Tell them the cart opens in 48 hours. Remind them it’s first come, 

first serve. 
ű	 Text a reminder.

ʶ	 24 HOURS OUT. Add first bonus. (Ex= Personalization - extra customization). Explain 
the benefits. Tell them to set an alarm so they don’t miss it because you expect it to sell 
out in minutes.

ű	 Send text.
ʶ	 60 MIN OUT.

ű	 Text to remind them to set an alarm and have their payment method ready.

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 10



The Fast Cash Playbook

ʶ	 5 MIN - Cart open. Add the best bonus here the moment you tell them the cart is open. 
(Ex= Experience - your personal cell).  You want this bonus to be the most immediate ben-
efit. So that the moment they respond they get an instant benefit.

ű	 Include text.
ʶ	 60 MIN POST - Sales update. How many sold already. How many left. 

ű	 Send text.
ʶ	 6 HOURS POST - X spots left. Add one bonus you didn’t mention. (Ex = Convenience 

- extended hours) And, the benefits of that bonus. Good stuff it helps them get. Bad stuff 
it helps them avoid. This should close out the offer.

ű	 Send text.
ʶ	 12 HOURS POST - Sold out. You let everyone know. It shows the promo was justified.

ű	 Send text. 
ʶ	 NEXT DAY - Back out one spot left. If you have someone back out.

ű	 Send text.
Note: I’d rather you sell out and then waitlist people who already tried to buy. If they 

had payment ready and just got there a little too late, get permission to notify them if a spot 
opens up– and charge them if it does.  

Ultra-Premium Examples

Think about the craziest thing you can offer. Then, offer it. If you need inspiration, use 
the Offer Creation Process Part I & II in $100M Offers to create your offer. Make sure to sep-
arate out your bonuses so you can drop them into the sequence to drive even more people 
to buy. To be clear, if you sell at a crazy high price, then you want to include the stuff before 
you cut things for being ‘unscalable.’ Main reason: these ‘unscalable’ solutions are the things 
that typically justify the crazy high price tags.

To make this real, below I have some examples of ultra premium offers for you. You may 
see them and think holy sh*t.  Yes. That’s the point. These are ultra-premium-white-glove of-
fers. Any fool can do less and charge less. But, we’re trying to do more so we can charge more. 
I’m not trying to make you pocket change, I’m trying to stuff your wallet in a week.

The Fast Cash Playbook

I make these to show you you don’t need to sell that many people to make a ton of money. 
And you work all the time now anyways, so might as well get paid better for it. Below you’ll 
find a Fast Cash: B2C offer, a B2B offer, and a subscription offer. 

B2C Fast Cash Offer - Fitness. Price: $10,000 
ʶ	 Offer: 1 on 1 Year Long “Total Transformation” Package. Aka “Look like a Greek 

god or goddess” by next year.
ű	 Core: Tailored Supplements. Meals. Workouts. Photoshoot. The works.

The Fast Cash Playbook

ʶ	 Note: This offer does exceptionally well. You can offer it to the existing customer 
base. It essentially gives them additional value for prepaying for the year. Typically 
you need to offer little else beyond the bonuses to get 10% to say yes. Highly, highly 
recommend.

Important Points

Ultra Premium Prices for Ultra Premium Value. If you think to yourself “I’m not giv-
ing anyone cell phone access!” You missed the point. It’s not about giving people access to 
your cell, it’s about offering crazy value. You have to balance what your customers find crazy 
valuable, how many of those things you’ll do, and if those things demand prices that would 
overflow your bank account in a few days.

Exclude Cooled-Off Leads. Fast Cash Plays work best with warm audiences. So, if your 
list has neglected leads - aka - you haven’t sent them anything for six months or more, con-
sider excluding them from this offer but start warming them up for the next one. For now, just 
stick with existing customers and past customers in good standing. 

Summary

ʶ	 Despite being a smaller percentage of yearly revenue, Fast Cash Plays can be a huge 
percentage of profit.

ʶ	 Fast Cash Plays work best with your warmest audiences. 
ʶ	 If cash maxing, make your offer an unscalable value for 10x to 50x your price and 

cap how many people can buy it.
ű	 You can price for volume, just scale the features and bonuses to accommo-

date. 
ű	 I recommend pricing high enough to make you happy about providing the 

unscalable value.
ʶ	 Prep all your emails and texts ahead of time.
ʶ	 Have your bonuses ready before you tell people about them.
ʶ	 Send your announcement.

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 13



The Fast Cash Playbook

ʶ	 Send each message with a countdown and a new bonus. Sell the bonus with expla-
nations of the good stuff they get from it, and the bad stuff it gets rid of. 

ʶ	 For automated checkout, build tension and start a first-come-first-serve stampede. 
ʶ	 For consults, make it available immediately, but get all sales appointments inside the 

seven-day window. 
ʶ	 Notify people via email and text message once you’ve sold a handful, when there are 

two left, when it’s sold out, and if someone backs out after.

5 Reasons To Run Fast Cash Offers Every 90 Days
“The most certain way to succeed is to always try one more time.” - Thomas Edison

As much as it would be great to run Fast Cash Plays every week… it doesn’t work. On the 
other hand, running them once a year doesn’t really work either… at least if you don’t hate 
money. I’ve found that once a quarter is the sweet spot for a few reasons: 

First, it cleans up your pipeline of qualified-but-on-the-fence leads. A great offer with 
urgency and scarcity will get them over the edge. This gets you more customers than you 
otherwise would have.

Second, it increases the value of every customer. People who buy more often are more 
likely to keep buying (provided your delivery doesn’t suck). 

Third, it always shows there’s something new and interesting going on. It shakes things 
up. This keeps customers engaged.

Fourth, doing it once per quarter allows you time to deliver and reset before running 
another Fast Cash Play. In short, it gets you into a cadence. 

Fifth, assuming your business is break-even or better, all the additional revenue from 
warm leads drops straight to the bottom line. So even if it’s a smaller percentage of revenue, 
it may become a much larger percentage of profit. All businesses should have one, especially 
if you are struggling to make more cash. 

ROI Benchmarks

I’ve already beaten the proverbial profit horse on this one. But, I want to make the num-
bers real for you. These are what we would see with a business doing $25,000 per month in 
recurring revenue from a gym with 166 members paying $150 per month. A gym like that 
often runs 25% margins. So, $6250 per month in profit. So, $75,000 per year. Now, let’s 
look at what adding a fast cash calendar does. My Fast Cash Plays run at least 90% gross 
margins - yours should too. Don’t worry, 10% of a massive number still gives you plenty of 
cash to spoil your customer. The point is to make money. Here’s what your returns might 
look like. 

Fast Cash Q1: 10 people buy at $6,000 = $60,000 +3 new customers
Fast Cash Q2: 13 people buy at $5,000 = $65,000 +2 new customers

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 15



5 Reasons To Run Fast Cash Offers Every 90 Days

Fast Cash Q3: 8 people buy at $6,000 = $48,000 +1 new customer
Fast Cash Q4: 14 people buy at $4,000 = $56,000 +2 new customers
Total Extra Cash: $229,000
Old revenue: $300,000 per year. Net income: $75,000.
New revenue: $529,000 per year. Net income: $281,000 per year.
A 76% increase in revenue that yields a quadrupling of net income and 22 new custom-

ers. Now, I don’t know about you, but if I could get new customers and quadruple my net 
income and by just sending a few emails a quarter…I would do it. (Surprise, I have… and it 
happens). The crazy thing is - most people don’t because they think stuff like this isn’t “scal-
able.” But it is. And, you know what helps you scale it…all the extra money you just made 
selling high margin stuff to your existing customers!

If this doesn’t convince you to at least give it a try. To at least try it once. I don’t know 
what will. And worst case, if you feel you need to give it longer than twelve weeks to cool off 
between promotions, run it twice a year instead. No big deal…it’s still free money. 

Author Note: This playbook fits as one playbook in my Cash Calendar 
playbook. Think of these like little pay raises you give yourself…every year. If 
you layer them together, you can also generate referrals, get new customers, 
increase retention…all without any added costs. In other words, all cash all year 
round. Look out for that playbook when it comes out…

What To Do Next

Pick your promotion. Assemble your list. Prep your team. Fill in the blanks for the 
emails and texts. Send them to your list. Take the consults. Make money. Tag me in your re-
sults so we can encourage other entrepreneurs to stay in the fight. Oh yea…once you make 
all this extra cash…don’t forget to pay your taxes.

DO YOU WANT TO SCALE YOUR BUSINESS?

Selling more to your existing customers isn’t only smart business, it’s essential 
to keeping customers long term. And giving clear offers with deadlines converts 
a higher percentage of the leads you get. So you both get more customers - and 
- make them worth more. And better yet, all the added revenue, if executed as 
I laid out, should disproportionately drop to the bottom line. Running even one 
Cash Play per year will pay for itself many years over. On the other hand, if you 
implement this incorrectly, you can seem like a shill, turn off 
good customers, and make room for better competitors.

Sample Email And Text Sequence
“A good example has twice the value of good advice” - Albert Schweitzer

It’s one thing to read how something works. It’s another to see it work. Below, I give you 
a sample sequence that has worked countless times. It’s not fancy. It’s a little hokey. But, like 
I said, it works. If you nailed the offer, you should sell out by day three or four. If you haven’t 
sold out, or at least a substantial percentage, consider adding things to the offer to make it 
more compelling before sending the remaining emails and texts.

I like pairing texts with emails. The texts draw attention to the emails. The emails give 
the details. Pretty simple. This sample campaign books consults since that’s my bread and 
butter. And after this, it will be your bread and butter, too. Ideally, you book and close ev-
eryone before the deadline which drives urgency for the deal.

 I use a seven-day campaign so I meet with everyone to close them. Any longer and it 
loses urgency. Any shorter and I miss out on sales. 

I also included the texts within the promotion schedule. I put the emails below the 
schedule since they take up more room. Just fill in the [BRACKETS] with the bonuses and 
features you want to include with your fast cash offer.

What if, by not taking action now, you don’t make the «NEXT STEP» in your progress? 

And maybe…the habit of waiting for the next one is why you aren’t where you want to be 
right now.

The truth is a whopping 41.7% of people will spend more on their cell phones and cars than 
on their goals. 

And the last time I checked, you will [be in your body/home/business] longer than that fan-
cy car and phones become obsolete the moment you open the box/drive it off the lot. 

But [being in better shape/feeling safe in your home/building a profitable business] allows 
you to do more, feed your family, and make the impact you want to have. In a nutshell, it 
allows you to be more. 

The [OFFER NAME] expires tonight at 7 pm, and while we have an EXTREMELY great 
group of customers, I know there are a few more that should do it! 

To get in, reply back to this message or text me at XXX-XXX-XXXX

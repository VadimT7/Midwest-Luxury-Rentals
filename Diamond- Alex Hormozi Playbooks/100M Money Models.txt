A Quick Word
LEILA:

I wrote this dedication seven years ago in my first book…

I want to thank my partner, my ride-or-die, Leila. You found me at my
absolute worst, and you have fought beside me shoulder to shoulder ever
since. You said you would sleep with me under a bridge if it came to that,
and I have never forgotten. You stood tall when everything was crumbling
around me. I would go to war with you. I would die for you. If the world
were a hurricane, standing with you is like being in the eye, calmly
observing the storm raging around us. There’s no one else I’d want by my
side to fight the battles that come. Being with you makes the stars look
within reach. Here’s to a life filled with the impossible.

And seven years later…nothing’s changed.

TREVOR: As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another.
Proverbs 27:17 It’s a rare and wonderful thing to have the smartest man
you’ve met call you a friend. If ignorance is the only true evil, and
knowledge, the only true good, you, my brother, are a force of good. The
world is better with you in it. And I will fight to keep it that way. My life
wouldn’t be the same without you. I wouldn’t be the same without you. I
doubt I will ever be able to repay the favor you have given me by being in
my life. But I’ll live trying. Thank you for giving me a gift far more than a
paragraph at the beginning of a book can ever repay. We will put our brick
in the wall. Here’s to a once in a generation friendship. Philia.

The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken

Where I slept at my first gym: my “concrete bedroom.”



I stared at the ceiling in the dark, alone. I had no one to go to. It sounds
cool when you tell the story later, but it didn’t feel that way. I was terrified.

I went against my father’s wishes. I skipped out on business school. I
spent all my savings. Everyone I cared about told me not to do it. I was the
idiot that gave up on a good career.

I thought I would look forward to the struggle. But, it got real…fast.

Kids partied all night in the parking garage above me. They’d race over
the steel dividers. It sounded like gunshots echoing in my concrete bedroom.
And as soon as I started to pass out, I’d get jolted awake by another bang-
bang bang-bang.

I finally gave up trying to sleep at night. I settled for midday naps—in the
utility closet. Then, in the dead of night, I worked. I had to make money.



My gym sat across the street from a large storage unit business. The
owner became one of my few members…only out of convenience. A few
weeks after he joined, he pulled me aside after his workout. “I’ve been doing
a little math,” he said, “It looks like you’re struggling.” I tried to hide my
embarrassment, but I failed. “Alright kid. Let’s grab breakfast tomorrow.” I
hesitated, thinking about my bank account. Before I could answer, he said
“...don’t worry. My treat.” Relief.

The next morning we met at the local diner at around 5 AM.

As the waitress brought our coffee, he asked “How much time you got left
to live?”

“Huh?”

“How much cash you got saved up?”

“About five grand.”

“How much time does that give you before you run out?”

I thought about it for a moment. “About a month.”

“Tough. How you getting customers?”

“I have a $39 six-week special on a discount site.”

“How many customers have you gotten?”



“Four.”

“Looks like you’ve got a problem…that you need to solve…fast.” He let
his statement sink in. Then I saw a grin spread across his face. “Let me ask
you a question… How much does a free month of storage cost?”

I shrugged…“Uh, nothing?”

He took note of my confusion and said “Alright, let’s go for a ride. I’ll
explain it at my facility.”

As soon as we walked in, the girl at the front desk greeted us. “Good
morning, gentlemen!”

“Good morning, Judy. How much does a free month of storage cost?”

“$127 sir,” she replied cheerfully.

He smiled and he turned to me. “Wanna know how?” I nodded. He took
me through the office and down one of the rows of freshly painted units.
“So, we advertise the first month as free, and it is. But what’s the first thing
you need after you get a storage unit?”

“I don’t know.”

“Exactly. Nobody really does. But I do—and I help ‘em out. So let me
give you a hint…” He pointed towards the lock on the door.

“Right…a lock!”

“Yea, and not one of those flimsy locks kids use on their lockers. Those
won’t fit anyway. Besides, any goon with bolt cutters can get through ‘em in
a second…but not one of these bad boys.” He tapped the lock to emphasize
his point.

“Yeesh, it looks like it. Where do you even get one of those?”

“Funny you should ask. I’ve got a whole storage unit full of them. Yours
today for just $47 bucks.”



“Okay, okay…I get it. They come in for the free month but what good is a
storage unit unless you can lock it?”

“Exactly,” he said.

“I get it, so where does the other $80 come from?”

“Great memory. So, what else are you gonna want?”

I shrugged.

“Well, if you have stuff to store. You’re gonna need boxes to store it in!
But, never fear. We’ve got boxes with tons of different shapes and sizes to fit
all your storage needs. We also offer tape, labels, and heavy duty markers to
make sure you know exactly what’s in every box and where you put it. Super
handy.”

“Oh, duh. That makes perfect sense.”

“What else are you gonna need?”

“I don’t know…help moving it?”

“Yes! Now, we don’t actually offer in-house moving services. But, we
have an affiliate relationship with a local moving business and make a
kickback. And if you want to move all the stuff yourself, that’s fine too. We
have dollies, hand trucks, straps and other useful tools available…for a fee.
After all, why buy a bunch of stuff you’ll only use once? What a waste!”

“Oh yea, didn't think of that.”

“What else are you gonna want?”

“Uh, I really don’t know.”

“Well, what you store is valuable, right? At least, valuable to you in some
way. I mean, if it wasn’t, you’d send it all to the dump! So…you’re gonna
want some insurance in case something bad happens. Now, I already give
$500 of free insurance to all customers. But if you have one of the special



locks only I offer, I’ll bump it to $100,000, for only an extra $10 per month.”
He puffed up with pride.

“Dang. And all that adds up to 127 bucks?”

“Yep. But, we’re not done yet. You know what always seems to happen?”

Onto his game now, I played along. “Beats me, what happens?”

“Everyone has way more stuff than they think. And they always rent too
small of a unit! In fact, it happens so often we always offer one size up. They
get the space they need and we make a few extra bucks. It works out for
everyone.”

“Wow. This is pretty cool. I didn’t know any of this stuff.”

“Of course not. Why would you?”

“Fair enough. But how can I use this to grow my gym?”

“Yeah. I've been playing this game as long as you’ve been alive. And
when you figure out how to make money in one business, and I mean really
figure it out, you see ways to make money in any business. And one thing’s
for sure. The longer you play, the more you learn.”

“Wow, so you’ve had this place for 23 years?”

“This place, no. This one is one of my newer locations.”

“You have more than one?”

“I have 27.”

“Oh…crap.” I felt two inches tall.

“Anyways, I gotta get to work. You know your way out?”

“Yea,” I chuckled. “I think I can make it across the street.”

2.5 years later . . .



I now had six gyms. I had leveled up. And I wanted to level up again. So I
paid $25,000 for an hour of time with a famous marketer. I had never spoken
to him. But I knew his stuff like the back of my hand. I had one goal for this
call—for him to help me scale my gyms.

After brief introductions, we dove in.

“...so, yeah, and that’s how I open my gyms at full capacity on day one. I
put $3,000 down for a lease and run a few day’s worth of ads. I sell
customers in the empty building. Then the cash from those sign-ups goes
toward more ads, equipment, paint, flooring, furniture, signage, and
whatever else the location needs. Doing it this way, I’ve opened up a new
location every six months with no debt.”

“Wow—so cool! Explain it to me in a bit more detail, would you?”

His business was making a million bucks a month. Those numbers blew
my mind. And he wants to hear how -I- advertise? I beamed with pride.

“I advertise a Free 6 Week Challenge until I get about 20 leads per day,” I
said.

“Got it, keep going,” he said.

“About half the leads show for appointments. I sell half of those who
show into a $600

program. So about 25% of my leads become paying customers. I also get
another $80 in

profit per customer from supplement sales. Not too shabby.”

“Agreed,” he grunted. “So you make like 680 bucks per customer before
you even open your

doors. Pretty dang good…but you left something out.”

“What did I leave out?”



“How much you payin’ per lead?”

“Oh…$5.” If a deafening silence ever happened in my life—this was it.

He stuttered a bit, “So you put one dollar in…and get 34 dollars out…in
48 hours?”

“Yeah? Is that good?”

“It’s amazing,” he said. “Do you have anything happening on the back
end?”

I grinned ear-to-ear. “Yea! A few weeks later, I tell them they can get their
$600 back as credit if they choose to sign up for a year. Two-thirds of sign-
ups convert into memberships. So I end up with a full gym and $20,000 of
monthly memberships…for $3,000 down. Then I rinse and repeat.”

“Wait a second, you do all this in thirty days?”

“Yep. Pretty cool right?”

He rubbed his eyes. “You shouldn’t be running gyms.”

Oh god. I thought he was going to compliment me—but he told me I
should quit? My mind raced…

“Alex,” he said, snapping me back to reality, “you have a level-10 skill in
a level-2 opportunity.”

Well, at least he doesn’t think I suck. “Ok, what should I do?”

“You shouldn’t be running gyms. You should be showing other gym
owners how to do what you just showed me.”

I hated the idea of giving up on what I took years to build. But…he made
a lot more money than I did. I figured, if I ignored his advice, I may as well
burn my money. So, I took his advice. ***



Over the next nine months, I closed down my newest gym and sold my
other five. That gave me the time to go all in on my new company: Gym
Launch. Over the next two years, I flew around the country turning gyms
around. Then, after 30+ turnarounds, I switched to a licensing model. I no
longer flew out in person. Instead, I helped them follow our proven model to
fill their gyms and increase profits. A small market to be sure, but they were
starving—some literally. But once they filled their gym in thirty days, they
told their friends. Gym Launch took off like a rocket. It was wild.

Over the next five years I took over $43,000,000 in owner distributions.
Then, I sold 66% of the company at $46,200,000 in an all-cash deal. With
that deal, I crossed a $100M net worth at age 31. And to be clear, no one was
more surprised than me.

From there, my wife and I founded our family office Acquisition.com to
invest in businesses we know how to grow. Our portfolio at the time of this
writing does over $200,000,000 per year in annual revenue. It spans brick &
mortar chains, software, services, and ecommerce. Even though we work in
many different industries, our companies all grow using the same principles
I share in this book.



 

So What’s In It For You?

In a few pages, I took you from sleeping on the floor to crossing
$100,000,000 in net worth. So the natural question is…how? Answer: by
making more money from customers than it costs to get them. And that’s
what this book $100M Money Models is all about.

Since I’ve been in business, the landscape has changed more than once.
And it’ll keep changing. The good news is, sound principles help you print
money no matter what. I've learned a lot of Money Models. I cover my
favorites here.



$100M Money Models shows already proven offers you can use
today. And, the instructions to

make them happen. Think of $100M Money Models as a book of winning
lottery tickets—all you have to do is cash them in.

Also, I want to make something clear, these are my private notes. If it’s
here, I’ve made money with it. These chapters contain my observations and
experiences with different businesses. From local chains, to physical
products, to services, education, software, and so on. And they were
scattered everywhere over the years. Until now.

This is my cookbook for making money.

How This Book Is Structured

This book teaches you one insanely profitable thing: how to build a
$100M Money Model. With a $100M Money Model, you make so much
money in the first thirty days that the cost of getting more customers will
never be a problem again. With so many customers, you’ll be forced to work
on everything else in your business to just keep up! A problem for another
book to solve (winky face).

Section I: What’s A Money Model?

“Hormozi has the highest return on advertising of any business using our
advertising tracking platform . . . by a mile. He has the biggest discrepancy
we’ve seen between dollars spent and dollars earned. And we only work with
businesses spending at least $250,000 per year on marketing or more, so
these are the cream of the crop marketers and his numbers are in the
stratosphere by comparison.” - Alex Becker, CEO, Hyros.com



 

December 2019.

“Hello sir, can I have your ID so I can look up your reservation?” the car
rental agent said, smiling. I already had my ID ready and slid it across the
counter.



“Hmm. It looks like we don’t have the car you reserved. We have an
equivalent car though… but you’re a big guy. Would you prefer a roomier
pick-up truck instead?”

“Yea, that sounds nice,” I said.

“I’ve got you down here for three days.” She cocked her head to the side a
bit. “Would you like to have a late return so you can turn in the vehicle at
any time during the day without worrying about late fees?”

I pulled up my schedule on my phone. “Yeah, we have an evening flight.
So that sounds good.”

“Great. Give me a second…just putting that in. So would you like better
insurance to cover any bumps or scratches on the car? It covers any and all
damage to the vehicle during your time.”

“Nope I’m good. No plans on drag racing while we’re here,” I joked.

“So only the minimum insurance then?”

“Yep. That’s all I’ll need.”

“Okay then, I’ll have your keys in a second. Did you want us to take care
of fuel so you don't have to worry about filling it up? You can return it on
empty and not worry about paying a fee. We do it for $3.75/gallon.”

“What's the gas around here?” I asked.

“About $3.50/gallon,” she replied cheerfully.

“Sure, why not. I hate filling it up when I’m rushing to catch a flight.”

“Alrighty then! Here’s your receipt. Just go around the corner and your
truck should be about halfway down on the left. Enjoy your trip!”

***



As I walked away, I glanced at the receipt and it stopped me in my tracks.
I could only laugh at myself. I came for a $19/day car and I left paying
$100/day. A 5x difference! And that’s the power of a well designed Money
Model. They knew everything I wanted (and things I didn’t even know I
would want). And when they offered them to me, I happily bought them.

A Money Model Happened



A Money Model is a sequence of offers. At their core, we find every
opportunity to solve a customer’s problem…and then offer to solve it. For
that reason, Money Models tend to have many offers in a specific order. If
you offer the right thing when customers realize they need it, you can make
as many offers as you like.

This is the rental car company’s Money Model stated plainly:

Offer #1 Vehicle Upgrade

Offer #2 Late Return

Offer #3 Premium Insurance

Offer #4 Minimum Insurance Downsell

Offer #5 Prepaid Gas

So yeah, I paid more, but it also solved more problems. Let’s break down
the problems she solved:

● She solved my ‘big man in a small car’ problem by offering a vehicle
that had more space.

● She solved my ‘late checkout’ problem by offering the flexibility to
keep the vehicle longer.

● She solved my ‘worries about dinging the car’ by offering insurance
to protect against it.



● She solved my ‘risk of missing my flight’ problem by offering a way
to prepay for the gas

ahead of time so I wouldn't have to do it on my ride back.

…And all those things cost money I was happy to pay.

The rental car company thought out every nuance. They told me about the
problem, then made their solution available to me. They offered solutions
for higher fees and hassles I might have had later for smaller fees in total
right now.

As a result, my $19 rental became a $100 rental. I paid more money faster.
And now, we can see why the car rental industry brings in billions in the
United States alone…per month. A successful Money Model.

Beware: Bad Money Models Kill Businesses

It costs many businesses more to get somebody to buy a thing than they
make in profit off the thing. In other words, they lose money getting new
customers—that’s a big problem.

And here’s what happens…

● They spend money to get customers. ● At the end of the month,
they realize they spent more than they made. ● They cut back on
advertising. ● Get fewer customers than they can handle because
they can’t afford them. ● Then, cut advertising altogether. ● Float
the business with personal cash, loans, credit, and then…pray for
profit. ● Sell percentages of their business just to keep the lights
on. ● Wait months (or years!) to make their money back…if ever.
● Fall further and further behind until… ● Finally, they lose it all.

But it doesn't have to be that way. There’s plenty of money. You
just have to go get it.

In traditional business, the slow drip of profits from lots of customers
eventually pays for a single customer. This ‘drip’ starves the business of
cash. It means they can only get lots of customers through advertising…if



they already have lots of customers! Big companies (or small companies
with investors) can do this because they have the money to burn.

Think about it this way. If you spend $100 in advertising to get a customer
and make $500 in profit from them, that’s a great deal. You should take it all
day. But what if it takes you two years to make your cash back? It’s a great
business…if you already have tons of cash in the bank. Otherwise, you’re
gonna run out of money. That leaves you with two options:

Option #1: Wait two years to get paid and pray you don’t run out of
money.

Option #2: Get paid fast and grow as much as you darn well please.

A good Money Model is option 2.

Good Money Models Make Millionaires

 

If you make more offers, and people buy them, you make more money. If
you make more money, you can use it to get more customers. If they pay you
that money faster, the faster you can get those customers and stay profitable.

But what if you make your customers twice as valuable, you get twice as
many of them, and get those customers at twice the speed?…your business
grows 8x faster. And if you triple them…your business grows 27x faster. See
where I’m going with this? You can get really big, really profitable, really



fast…with just a few changes. And that’s exactly what I'm gonna show you
how to do.

Next Up

Money Models are a sequence of offers. Different offers solve different
problems. So if you want to win, you have to figure out what to offer next.
To figure that out, you’ve gotta understand The Four Offer Types…



The Four Types of Offers That Make Money
Models

Stop being poor. - Paris Hilton

The limit does not exist. - Lindsay Lohan, Cady Heron in Mean Girls

Making one offer works better than making none. And making more
offers works better than making one. Combining offers in a sequence makes
a Money Model. My Money Models combine four different offer types.

Four Types of Offers

There are four types of offers: Attraction Offers, Upsell Offers, Downsell
Offers, and Continuity Offers. All improve our Money Model, but they all do
it differently. They work great on their own, but together they make your
business unstoppable.

1. Attraction Offers turn strangers into customers.

2. Upsell Offers get people to spend more cash.

3. Downsell Offers get people to say yes when they would have said
no.

4. Continuity Offers keep people buying.



 

If you look at great businesses, you’ll see different versions of these offers
as core components of their money-making engine. You can use one, two,
multiples of one, or all four together. You can combine them however you
want. But, when I look at my most profitable businesses, I used all four. And
here’s why:

If you don’t have an offer for getting customers, you won’t get as many.
But let’s say you do. If you only have that one thing to offer, you won’t
make nearly as much money as you could. So if you have something to offer
next, an upsell, you’ll finally get some cash. But, you still won’t make as
much as you could because lots of people will still say “no.” So, we turn
those “nos” into “yeses” with downsells. And that works fine. But it would
be even better if you had that extra cash guaranteed to come in month after
month. So, you make a continuity offer to top it off. That’s how I like to do
it.

How I Structured The Sections

I start with Attraction Offers, because if you’re not getting customers, you
need one of those first. Then, we cover Upsell Offers, followed by Downsell
Offers. Then to finish the four types, I show you my favorite Continuity
Offers exactly how I learned them.



How I Structured Each Chapter

Each chapter has six elements:

1. Doodle directly from my notes. Exactly as I drew it. It helped
me remember it, so it

will help you remember it, too.

2. The story of how I first learned this Money Model. 3. A
description of how the Money Model works. 4. A few examples
of how this Money Model works in different industries. Think of

how you could use the Money Model in your business.

5. Important notes and tactics that make the Money Model work.
These tidbits help

you execute the play—like it's your hundredth time doing it—on
your first try.

6. A summary. All the important points about the Money Model.
Plus, some extra

thoughts sprinkled in about how to make the Money Model
more profitable.

Important Notes:

Alright. Before I release this pile of gold nuggets I need to make a few
things clear:

1) All Businesses Have Money Models. It Makes A Business A
Business. Switch

the poor person mantra “this won’t work for my business” to
the rich person mantra “how will I make this work for my
business?” They all work. Be creative.



2) Some Money Models Work Better In Some Businesses Than
Others. They’re

just different ways to offer stuff. If you just try to copy what
“they” do you’ll be disappointed. To make it work for your
business, you have to design your own (but don’t worry, I’ll
show you how).

3) If A Customer Asks For Their Money Back—Give It Back.
Avoid the headache.

And if you made a goof—fix the goof. Don’t be a silly goose.
Treat customers well. Next time, spend the time and resources
to get better customers.

4) Hard Selling Is For Weak Products. If someone doesn't want
something, that’s

OK. Don’t convince someone against their will. Make offers
available at the time your customer has a problem and you'll be
ahead of the competition. If they don’t want it, no sweat. Find
somebody who does. It’s a numbers game.

5) Obey The Law. I learned these plays in different situations
from different people

using different platforms, in different times, in different places,
following different rules. Advertising laws change all the time.
And they tend to only get tighter—especially when it comes to
“free.” Check with lawyers to see if an offer you want to make
is legal or not. This book is intended to be Money Model
inspiration. Use it that way.

6) Be Transparent. State the facts. And if the facts aren’t
compelling, change reality to

make them compelling or learn to frame them in a way that is.
Don’t lie. You’ll short-change yourself long-term. And unlike



credit card debt, you can’t file bankruptcy to erase a bad
reputation. Once you have a bad one, it sticks for life.

7) Any Offer Can Be Used On Its Own, At Any Time, in Any
Order. A business

works as long as it makes a profit. Most offers in this book
could meet that minimum requirement on their own. When used
in the right sequence, and at the right time, they make a $100M
Money Model. I’ve got big dreams, and I bet you do too. So,
we’re gonna use ‘em all.

With that said, let’s go for a ride.

First Up: Attraction Offers

Most businesses spend too much to get customers and make too little from
them. They are cash-constrained. But, you use cash to get more customers.
And I like more customers. So I always solve this first with an Attraction
Offer.

Section II: Attraction Offers

How to turn eyeballs into money.



 

Attraction Offers generate leads and convert them into customers. They
turn advertising into money by offering something free or at a discount. We
do this because everyone wants a great deal. In a great deal, customers get
far more value than the price they pay. Strangers can only take your word on
the value. But, they absolutely understand the price. For that reason,
discounts make anything a great deal to just about anyone. And, the greater
the discount, the better the deal. The greatest discount of all being free.

So first off, any time I say “free” you can also use “discount” or “$1.”
Any time I use “discount” you can also use “free” or “$1” and so on. They
exist on a continuum because they all discount a product to some level—
even if you discount it by 100%!



If you can imagine a way to use a discount or a free offer… then you can
do it. After that, I’ll let you use your noggin to exchange them as you see fit.

So How Do You Make Money By Offering Free Stuff ?

 

Think about it this way—people look for one thing and then buy another
by accident all the time. Attraction Offers get them to do it on purpose. But
what’s a better deal than free stuff? More and better free stuff. One free thing
is awesome. Two free things are awesomer. And, maybe to get those two free
things, they have to buy one. That's how we make money on free stuff.

In this section, I go over my five favorite ways to make money by offering
free stuff:

1. Win Your Money Back

2. Giveaways



3. Decoy Offer

4. Buy X Get Y Free

5. Pay Less Now or Pay More Later

Let’s make some money.



Win Your Money Back
If you do x within y time within z rules, you can get it free.

 

June 2013.

I was in a room full of experienced gym owners, and I was the new guy.
We all took turns talking about what was working well. That’s when Danny
piped up.

“Yea…so as you guys know, I’ve been struggling with sales…and I think
I got it figured out. I had this pain in the butt guy who wouldn’t buy
anything. He knew he needed it but he also said he needed more
accountability. So we were going back and forth, and finally he came up
with this idea. He said, ‘How about this: I give you $500. You train me for
eight weeks. And if I hit my goal, I get my money back. But in return, you can
use my results to market your business. Fair enough?’”

“So…what happened?” I asked.

Danny replied, “I figured he wasn’t gonna buy anyways, so I sold him.”



“Okay, so what happened with the guy?”

“He hit the goal.”

“So did you give him his money back?”

“That’s what you’d think, but he ended up using the money to buy more
training!”

“Seems decent enough. What about marketing his results?”

“Dude, marketing his before and after pictures brought in thirteen
referrals!”

“That’s insane. Now we’re talking.”

“Yea, I know. I offer this to everyone now. The results are way better and
people love the offer. And all the free advertising they do for us gets their
friends and family to join too. I’m making more money than ever.”

***

This is the first time I ever saw an offer like this. I updated it over time,
but the core stayed the same: pay now with a chance to get your money back
later. I used it for private training, group training, private nutrition coaching,
and group nutrition coaching. Once I saw how well it worked with my
current customers, I started putting the offer in my ads for new customers.
My cost of getting customers went way down and my leads exploded!

Description

A Win Your Money Back Offer works like this. You set a goal for the
customer and tell them how to reach it. If they reach it, then they qualify to
get their money back or get it back as store credit.

This offer grew my gyms better than any other. It was also the first Grand
Slam Offer that Gym Launch taught to gym owners. It has tons of flexibility.
So if you want to get more cash, get more customers, and get them better
results. Nothing beats it.



To ‘Win Your Money Back’ the person has three options: Get Results,
Take Actions, or both. And to make this work, you have to make the results
and actions simple to track.

Results: Here, no matter what they do, if the customer gets the result, they
win their money back. For example: Making $X a month, Getting Y
customers, Losing Z lbs etc. Basically, they bet on their own ability to reach
the goal.

Actions: Here, you hold them accountable for doing actions instead of
getting results. No matter what results they get, if the customer does what
you ask, they win their money back. For example: attend all sessions, calls,
meetings, log progress, take pictures, do assigned homework, etc. Here, they
bet on their ability to follow directions.

Actions and Results: Here, you hold customers accountable to following
directions and getting results. If they do both, they win their money back.
Often, people wanting to achieve a goal have too few skills to do it. Even if
they did bet on themselves, they’d fail. By setting a good goal for them and
showing how they reach it, they have a fighting chance. Here they bet on
their ability to follow directions and that your directions will get them the
result.

Bottom Line: Customers put money down. If they do the stuff OR they
get the result OR both—they get it back as cash or store credit.

Examples

Business To Consumer Offer: Free 28-Day Blueprint

Deposit X dollars and get it all back if you:

Attend all your consulting calls.

Post your progress in the group once per week.

Journal daily in our app.



Attend your feedback session and your transformation session.
(Hint: calls and meetings become opportunities to make more
offers.)

Business To Business Offer: 5 Customers In 5 Days Free Challenge

Deposit X dollars and get it all back if you:

Send 100 messages per day.

Report stats on messages sent.

Attend daily training.

Post finished homework in the group.

Attend the day 5 consulting call.

(Hint: here you offer more, better, or new products and
services.)

Physical Product Offer: Put 1,000,000 Miles On Your Car, And Get A
Free Car

Get a free car if you:

Buy a new car from us.

Drive the car 1,000,000 miles.

Turn it in.

Take pictures and be in a press release.

We’ll credit all your original purchase price towards your next
car. (This was an actual offer.)

Important Notes



This offer has generated over $1 billion in sales industry-wide. It works. I
have made a lot of money with it. You can too.

Win Your Money Back Works With New, Current, And Previous
Customers. I like to use it with new customers because it offers the steepest
discount possible—100%. I like it with current customers because it mixes
them in with new customers. And I like to use it to get previous customers
back because bigger incentives get them to come back.

It Works Well With Stuff People Start And…Quit. Like starting
businesses, learning new skills, losing weight, building fitness, beauty
regimes, self-care, time management, mental health management, etc. It
keeps motivation during the early pains of learning. To this day, I have never
seen a better way of setting up a program for results—a true win-win.

Don’t Worry. This Offer Makes Money. If you did give all the money
back, this offer wouldn't make money—but it does. First, many won’t
qualify—even with realistic conditions. Second, those who do qualify often
stay as customers. But they can only stay customers if they have something
else to buy. So have an upsell ready to apply their winnings (Section III).

Only Offer “Win Your Money Back” If You Feel Ok With Giving
Money Back! Refunds are a part of doing business. However, when
advertised well, the Win Your Money Back offer gets tons of extra
customers. And when you give satisfied customers a great follow-up offer,
you make plenty of profit. This more than outweighs the refunds. From the
data we’ve collected from thousands of gyms, about 10% of all customers
will ask for their money back. If you can’t stomach it, don’t do this.

Offer Store Credit Instead of Cash. If you don’t want to offer cash back,
you can offer store credit instead. My testing showed offering store credit
and cash back got the same number of customers. So you might as well offer
store credit. But, if you still want to advertise it as ‘free,’ pair it with an
unconditional satisfaction guarantee. Adding the unconditional guarantee
never materially affected the number of people who wanted their money
back. Check with legal counsel in your area.



Don’t Take Blood Money. If someone doesn't want me to have their
money, I want it less than they do. As a personal rule, if a customer asks for
a refund—entitled or not—I give it to them. Just focus on getting the next
customer.

How To Create Your Win Your Money Back Criteria. These criteria
make or break this offer. Good criteria have three characteristics:

1) Easy To Track. Train them on exactly what they need to do
(or they will mess up).

Bonus points if people already do it. Ex: Phones already track steps. Word
processors already

track word count. Cameras automatically date photos.

2) Gets Customers Results. Make criteria likely to get them
their desired results.

Realistic criteria do just fine. If you think the criteria look too easy,
you’ve probably gotten

close to realistic. They may take a few tries to get right, but so does
anything else worth

making. Ex: attend meetings, workouts, watch videos, etc. Whatever stuff
the best customers

do to get the best results, make everyone do it (and they'll get great results
too).

3) Advertises The Business. Make advertising the business part
of your criteria.

For example: posting about their participation, tagging in social media,
referring, or leaving

reviews and testimonials.



How You Apply Store Credit [IMPORTANT]. When customers win
their money back, offer to apply it over a longer period or to a bulk package.
Just offer to apply it to something that costs more than their winnings. In my
experience, this keeps customers engaged and makes you more money.
Here’s what that looks like:

● You have a product or service that costs $200 dollars per month.

● A customer wins $600 of credit. Avoid giving them three free months
up front.

● Instead apply the $600 over 12 months → ($600/12 months = $50/mo
discount).

○ They now pay: $200 per month—$50 discount = $150 per
month

● To be clear, they can use credit however they want. But, I recommend
you present this first.

If they ask to use it up front, you can share my experience—people fall off
if they don’t pay

something. A discount over the long haul keeps them engaged over the
long haul. So it’s in the

customer’s best interest to keep some skin in the game.

● In-depth details on this Upsell Offer are in the Rollover Upsell
chapter (Section III).

All Meetings And Calls Provide Opportunities To Make More Offers.
Make check-in meetings part of your money-back criteria whenever you can.
And make all meetings required to win their money back. Beyond helping
them succeed, they are the best opportunities to make upsell offers. So after
you’ve checked in, offer what makes sense based on their feedback. The Win
Your Money Back Offer and my gyms had three appointments:



● Nutrition Orientation → “Before pictures”→ I make a supplement
offer.

● Progress Check-in → I make a membership offer.

● Transformation Feedback → “After pictures”→ I make the
membership offer again.

○ If they bought the membership at the last meeting, I offered a
discount if they

prepaid for a year.

Make Everyone A Winner. Promote and sell the program as though they
will only get it back if they meet the criteria. But, about halfway through,
make your next offer as if they already won. You lower the customer’s
anxiety about failing and you’ll keep them longer. They’ll also love you that
much more. Something like:

“I know you're trying to hit this short-term goal, but what’s your long-
term goal?...okay that’s great to hear. You get that it’s not about this program
but about your long-term results. Tell ya what, to show you how much I want
you to hit that long-term goal, I’ll credit this program toward the next one
whether you hit the short-term goal or not—how’s that sound?”

At The End Of The Program, Let The “Losers” Win. If someone
refuses your first upsell and fails the challenge, you can still upsell them
again. Here’s how: act like they won. I say something like:

“Don’t worry about it. You started. That's the biggest victory of all.
And even though you didn’t hit your

short-term goal, you met ours—which was finishing what you started. To
show you that we’re in this for the long haul, we’ll credit your entire deposit
towards staying with us long term. That way you get your money back and
we can still hit your goal. How does that sound?”

You’ll turn that frown upside down and they’ll love you for it. Remember
—we don’t get customers to make a sale, we make sales to get customers.



The Win Your Money Back Offer Has A Simple Structure With Lots
Of Flexibility. At its heart, you offer a product or service and a way for
customers to get their money back if they actually use it. Then, if they use it
the way you suggest, they will get good enough results and stay open to
more offers and/or longer term commitments.

Summary Points

Win Your Money Back is magical for businesses that require their
customers to put in continuous efforts to get their ideal outcome.

● The Win Your Money Back Offer rocks because:

○ You get loads of up front cash. ○ You get more customers to say
yes since you lower their risk. ○ You get massive results for
customers. ○ You get more long-term customers. ○ They advertise
your offer to get you even more customers.

● Making some meetings a part of the terms gives great opportunities to
check in with your

customers and make more offers specific to their needs.

● Everyone thinks businesses make money on people who fail the program.
No. The real

money comes from people who succeed with it and you have something
else to offer them. Trust

me on this one. The more results you deliver, the more money you’ll
make. Think long.

● Make refund criteria easy to track, aligned with customer goals, and
helpful for the business.

● Only use a Win Your Money Back Offer if your refund rate is below
5%. Otherwise, fix your

product before doing this. You risk giving too many refunds.



● Put the store credit toward another, preferably more expensive, offer.
You want them to stay

customers…so give them the opportunity. You never want people to stop
paying you.

● To make more sales and keep more customers, make everyone a
winner in private. That way,

everyone stays surprised and grateful when you make your Upsell Offer.



Giveaways
Many will enter…many will win.

 

August 2020.

I hopped on the phone with the owner of a fitness certification business to
talk shop. In a few minutes, he gave me the rundown about how they certify
fitness enthusiasts and help them find clients.

“Interesting business you’ve got,” I said. “How do you get leads?”



“It’s pretty simple. We advertise a full-ride scholarship to our entire
program. People apply with their contact information and then answer a few
questions. We ask stuff like ‘Why should we pick you for the full-ride
scholarship?’ The best answer gets a full-ride. But we also do something
more…”

“Nice, keep going…” I said.

“We give out partial scholarships.”

“What do you mean? How does that work?”

“Well, we often have a clear winner for the full-ride. But tons of people
have inspiring stories, so I want to make sure they got scholarships too. Now
I can only give away one full-ride, but I can give away as many partial
scholarships as I want.”

And then it hit me.

“Ooohhh…So lots of people apply for the ‘grand prize’ and only one
person gets that. But the other applicants qualify for smaller prizes?”

“Right. So I make a big deal out of the person who wins the full-ride
scholarship, but then I call everyone else to let them know they got a partial
scholarship. When I talk to them, they’re thrilled. Most of them join our
program on the spot.”

“So they don’t know the actual price of your thing when they hop on the
call?”

“Nope.”

“But they know the value of the full-ride scholarship, and when you
present the discounted price of your program with the partial scholarship, it’s
still huge savings.”

“Exactly.”



“So not only do you get tons of engaged leads, but you also get more
customers with your ‘surprise discount?’ Genius.”

“It works really well. We actually have to cap it to make sure we can
service all the new sign-ups. Believe it or not, we teach the same play to the
trainers we certify. It works just as well to get fitness customers—sometimes
even better.”

“Love it.”

***

He presented this as an education offer and as a fitness offer. But it’s so
much more. I’m gonna show you how to use it in any business. Free
Giveaways generate many leads who show interest in your most expensive
product. What could be better?

Description

Giveaway Offers advertise a chance to win a big prize in exchange for
contact information and whatever else you want. Then, after picking a
winner, you offer everyone else the big prize at a discounted price.
Giveaways also go by names like “scholarship” and “sweepstakes” and
“raffles” etc. They all mean “enter for a chance to win.” To run a Giveaway
Offer you:

● Pick a Grand Prize.

● Pick your promotional offer.

● Ask for contact information and other eligibility criteria.

● Pick what actions you want entrants to take to qualify for the big
prize.

● Put the giveaway on a deadline to add urgency.

● Announce the Grand Prize winner and contact everyone else.



Let’s go into each with more detail.

Pick A Grand Prize. Make your Grand Prize the thing you want everyone
to buy. Make sure you assign a monetary value to your grand prize to serve
as a price anchor. For instance, if you sell $5,000 worth of value for $2,000,
then advertise the $5,000 value!

Pick Your Promotional Offer. Your promotional offer takes the place of
the “partial scholarship” in the story. You create it by enhancing your core
offer with a discount, a bonus, or by minorly changing it from the Grand
Prize in order to ethically justify a price reduction (using the Grand Prize as
a price anchor). And the bigger the discount, the more compelling the offer.
So the bigger the value you assign your Grand Prize, the better!

Remember, leads entered the Giveaway because they found the Grand
Prize interesting. It gets you qualified leads because you offer what they
already showed interest in at a discount. Call your promotional offer—the
thing you sell to everyone else—whatever you want for your giveaway:
scholarship, gift card, dollars off, store credit, vouchers, etc.

Ask For Contact Information. In exchange for a chance to win, ask for
permission to contact them any way you please for follow-up promotions.
Beyond that, I survey for prize eligibility and then ask them to take
qualifying actions.

Eligibility. I ask if they’re a fit for my products. Like ‘Do you own a vet
clinic?’ or more character/need-based questions like ‘Why should you be
selected?’

Qualifying Actions. Other stuff entrants do to qualify to win. I also use
these to get them to promote my giveaway more, or demonstrate higher
levels of interest. Ex: attending a call or event, making a post, entering a
group, etc.

Put The Giveaway On A Deadline To Add Urgency. Set a date for the
Grand Prize drawing. Make your Giveaway more urgent by only making it
available for a limited time. I like three to seven days from the day I start
promoting it. As soon as leads enter the Giveaway—update them daily. First,



let them know how long they have left until you announce the winner. You
can do this with email, direct messages, texts, social media posts, and so on.
Do as many as reasonable. Once a day across all platforms works fine.
Second, provide value along with your countdown. Show everyone the
benefits of the grand prize, how excited they should be, and refer everyone
to social proof. Keep the hype alive!

Announce The Grand Prize Winner And Start Contacting Everyone
Else. Announce the Grand Prize winner publicly, then message everyone
else who qualifies for your core offer privately. The beauty is—everybody
else qualifies for your promotional offer. Notify them by text, email, and
direct messages. In that message, ask them to schedule a call because they
qualified for something else. If you need a reason—just say you found their
answers/story so compelling you felt obligated to give them something just
for entering. Think of your promotional offer like a “participation trophy.”

To make sure they redeem, add another deadline. Make claiming your
promotional offer (the scholarship, gift card, dollars off, store credit,
vouchers, etc.) expire in seven days. The second countdown works like the
first: show the benefits, more social proof, and more valuable stuff about
your offer. Give them a way to book a call to claim the promotional offer.

Explain The Cost-To-Value Using Their Discount. My rule of thumb:
make your core offer discount equal to 10%–30% of your gross margins. Say
we advertise a Grand Prize with a $5,000 value with a $2,000 retail price
tag. Everyone else gets it for $1,800 (a 10% discount off retail). When we let
them know they qualified for something, we explain they get $5,000 in value
for an $1,800 price tag. By comparing the value of the thing to what they
pay, a 10% discount becomes a 64% difference in cost-to-value!



Bottom Line: Remember, everyone that entered the Giveaway showed
interest in your thing. And if somebody shows interest in a thing you have to
offer—offer it to them.

Example Free Giveaways

Dentist Offer—Free Perfect Smile Giveaway Grand Prize: A free set of
invisible braces—$6,000 retail price Promotional Offer: $2,000 gift card for
braces

Physical Products Offer—Free Year Of Organic Dog Food Grand Prize:
Free Year of Organic Dog Food—$1,000 retail price Promotional Offer:
$300 gift card for dog food only useable with a one-year subscription

Services Offer—Free Ultimate Giveaway Grand Prize: Free 1-Year
Package—$5,000 retail price

Promotional Offer: $2,000 voucher redeemable toward 1-Year Service
Agreement

Consulting Offer—Free 16-Week Turnaround Giveaway Grand Prize:
16-Week Turnaround—$12,000 retail price

Promotional Offer: $6,000 Partial Scholarship

Important Notes:

Consult Legal Counsel About How To Structure Your Giveaway. I’m
not legal counsel, but I do consider these no-brainers because of the way I
like to do business: somebody actually has to win the Grand Prize. Make the
Grand Prize, and qualifications to win, clear in the rules. Make clear that
more than one person can win a prize. Ask your legal counsel about the rest.

Eligibility Criteria Get More Customers To Buy Your Core Offer.
More people will take your core offer if you can make the value specific to
them. I ask questions like this to get ammo: Why should we pick you? Why
this program? Why now? Why does this matter to you? Why is this
important to you? What’s your goal? Etc.



That being said, the more work you make it to enter the fewer people will
enter, but the more qualified they’ll be—so find your sweet spot.

If Your Giveaway Doesn’t Work, It Means Your Grand Prize Wasn’t
Grand Enough. One of my portfolio companies ran a giveaway. They
barely got interest. Their grand prize? Tickets to their event. Not compelling.
I told them grand prizes only work if they’re grand. They tried it again with
a $50,000 bundle of equipment from a well-known industry supplier plus
their core product for a year. And, this time, it crushed (surprise).

When you have an awesome thing to give away and you advertise it
properly, the leads flood in. And “Giveaway” kinda explains itself. So if
nobody bites, then I suggest you give away something better. Or at least,
better for the audience.

Give Away Two Prizes For Twice The Leads. If you give away one
prize, that’s fine. But if you give away two grand prizes, you can get twice
the leads (or more). Here’s how. Just tell everyone that if someone they refer
wins the grand prize, they win one too. That way, they get endless ‘entries’
into the contest by referring their friends. This gets more people to refer (and
work together). This also provides a sneaky benefit. Referrers are invested in
the success of their referrals. This keeps quality high. Here’s an example I
did for Skool.com, a platform I co-own for people to build and monetize
communities.



 

Scarcity, Scarcity, Scarcity. Limit your giveaway by time, number of
entries, or both. You can run giveaways for a specific amount of time (ex:
seven days), a specific number of entries (ex: 5,000 entries), or both. I like
both. I match how many people I let enter the giveaway with the number of
people I have the time and resources to connect with inside seven days. Any
more would be a waste.

Urgency, Urgency, Urgency. I add urgency in three places—to enter, to
claim, to use. Make how long they have to enter clear in the advertisements.
Once you announce the winner(s), let them know how long they have to
claim. When they do, schedule their call the same day or the next day (if you
can). Once you let people know what they won, tell them how long they



have to use it. I like hours, but I have gone up to five days. In short, always
have deadlines.

Have Downsells Available. Some won’t or can’t buy your promotional
offer, even with the discount or bonus. And that’s okay. Here’s how I
approach it: at the start of the call, let them know they qualified for two
prizes. And that you’ll help them find which way makes the most sense for
them. Then, present your promotional offer first—aka, the discount on the
Grand Prize thing. If they take it, great. If not, then offer the same discount
by percentage on any other product you have that makes sense for them.

If You Have A Recurring Revenue Business. Apply their discount over
the longest period of time they’ll agree to. Then, set up their monthly
subscription to bill automatically at normal rates after the discounted period
ends.

Summary Points

● At their core, Giveaways ask an audience to apply to get a high-value
thing of yours for free.

Many will enter—one wins. The rest qualify for discounts on your core
offer.

● Pick a Grand Prize people want.

● Give two prizes away if you want more people to refer. Tell them if
someone they refer wins,

they win the other prize.

● Offer a chance to win the Grand Prize to anyone who enters and
qualifies.

● You can get great information from every lead because you can make
it part of the entry

process. Get information that indicates how your offer will provide them
value. This



becomes important for making offers later.

● Advertise your Giveaway for seven days, or until the number of leads
surpasses the number

of people you can manage to call in seven days, whichever comes first.

● Book appointments with everyone else to claim your promotional offer.
Use whatever

“reason why” feels good to you.

● Putting an expiration date on people claiming their prize makes them
more likely to claim it.

● If somebody says no to your core offer, have another product or
service to discount. It may

Decoy Offer
Which one do you think will get you the best results?

 

June 2014.

John, another early mentor, retired early. He spent his retirement raising
his girls, playing golf, and hanging out at his lake house. He was a man who
had lived.

Once in a while, he’d invite me to his lake house. And on those long
drives, he taught me things about life and business that I use to this day. Like
the difference between price and value. The pros and cons of low-cost offers.
High-volume, low-price business models. Differences between recurring
subscriptions and one-time transactions. And the art of keeping things simple
in business and life.

John was great company. I often wished we could drive forever so I could
soak everything in. To him, this was just another story to pass the time. But
to me, it was a lesson I would never forget:

The 5-Day $5 VIP Tanning Pass.

“You see, the beauty of the 5-Day Pass is everyone thinks they can get tan
in five days. And they can. But, it’s never as tan as they want to get. And if
they try to ‘speed things up’...they’ll burn. So, when someone comes in with
a pass, we ask them how tan they wanna get. As soon as they say they want
to get a few shades darker, we give them ‘the turkey talk’.”

“What’s the turkey talk?” I asked.

John smiled and continued. “Say a Thanksgiving turkey takes three hours
to cook. We all know what happens if you double the temperature to cook it
in half the time—you burn it! It takes at least five to ten sessions to get the
color they want without burning. And since they gotta take some time



between sessions, it always takes more than five days. Once they realize that
we say:

“‘Let’s just credit your VIP pass toward your first month. Why buy so
many $25 day passes when members get unlimited access for just $19.99?’

“They immediately see the value and take the membership. Easy as that.”

Five years later…

“Hey boss, we’ve got a problem.”

Oh boy… “What’s up?” I said.

“Our fitness leads have gotten way too expensive. The guys who can sell
are still making it work, but most of them are barely breaking even.”

“Dang, so it finally happened,” I said. I pressed my hands to my forehead.
I knew this was coming. And the truth is, I was dreading it.

I tried for weeks to put a “spin” on our previous offer. A new or interesting
twist would buy us time, but our tests so far fell flat. Crap.

“You got any more offers up your sleeve?” he asked.

I racked my brain then remembered the $5 VIP Tanning pass. That just
might work. “Why don’t we offer something super cheap to get the leads, but
when they come in, make them a crazy offer that costs more but is 100x
better. They can still take the cheap thing, but we’ll just explain that they’ll
get way better results with extra accountability, nutrition, etc.”

“Yea, I can run something like that.”

A few weeks later…

“Alex, I think we cracked it.”

“Awesome! Walk me through it.”



“So we give two options. The first option is free. I give one session per
week. The second option is an ‘Ultimate’ Version for $399. It comes with
unlimited sessions, 1–1 coaching, more personalized stuff, and a guarantee
they’ll get results or they repeat the program for free…”

“Oh man…that guarantee is solid. What’s the take rate?”

“We got about eight out of ten people to take the $399 option. We’re
crushing it.”

“Awesome—let’s scale it!”

***

John was a brilliant salesman and patient teacher. His philosophy of giving
customers what they want now, so you can give them what they need later
shaped many ways I do business. He also inspired the offer that saved my
gym. But the most valuable thing I learned from him was: “You have to
know what gets results for customers better than they do. This makes our
premium offer the clear solution.” And making our premium the clear
solution is what Decoy Offers are all about.

Description

Decoy Offers advertise something free or discounted. Then, when leads
ask to learn more, you also present a more valuable premium offer. The
premium offer provides more features, benefits, bonuses, guarantees, and so
on. By putting your decoy offers and premium offers side-by-side, leads can
see how much more valuable your premium offer is. I like Decoy Offers
because they get more customers overall. They either take the decoy version
or the premium version. If they take the premium, great. If they take the
decoy, also great. It gives you time to upgrade them rather than losing them.
But either way, you can close everyone. This makes it cheap and profitable
to get new customers. And any business can use it.

Here are the steps to make a Decoy Offer:

1) Advertise a lesser, smaller, or simpler version of your premium
offer as a decoy. 2) When leads engage, offer both options, but



emphasize the premium one.

 

Examples

Lemonade Stand Offer (Physical Products)

Attraction Offer: “Free Week of Lemonade” OR “$1 Week of
Lemonade.” Decoy Option: “You can have this water +
powdered lemon + corn syrup” Or…

Premium Option: “The organic, all-natural, vegan, gluten-free,
imported Italian lemons, which are cold-processed and shipped
straight to your door. You’ll never need to waste time coming to
the store again. It’ll have you feeling like a labrador puppy
chasing butterflies all day. It also comes with other flavors, like
our sparkling rosewater lemonade.”

Float Tank Center (Service)



Attraction Offer: “Free 6-Week Stress Release” OR “$6 6-Week
Stress Release.” Decoy Option: One float per month with at-
home do it yourself stress relief exercises. Premium Option:
Two times per week floats for 6 weeks, 1–1 consulting, journal,
sleep routine. Satisfaction guaranteed.

Gym Offer (Local Business)

Attraction Offer: “Free 21-Day Transformation” OR “$21 21-
Day Transformation.” Decoy Option: Workouts done in a
Skool.com group once a day. A general nutrition plan. Can
watch recordings. No support. No guarantee.

Premium Option: Unlimited workouts, a personalized nutrition plan, 1–1
accountability, results guaranteed (or you get another 21 days free).

Important Notes

How To Make Your Decoy Offer. Offer fewer components, older models,
or fewer personalized versions of your premium offer. Also, remove any
guarantees. Your Attraction Offer only has to get leads to engage. Nothing
more.

Advertise Benefits Not The Features. We want to sell them on the dream
outcome. We advertise a transformation in 21 days, not workouts and meal
plans. Leads get specific product details in the sales presentation, not in the
advertising! Private jets and rowboats can both get you to an exotic island,
but the premium option is certainly more enjoyable.

You Can Advertise Discounts in Four Ways. Let’s say you had a year-
long thing that costs $100 per month. If you wanted to let them pay $900 for
the year, you could say:

1) Percentage Off: 25% off

2) Absolute Amount: $300 off

3) Free Portion: 3 Months Free



4) The Total Package: One Year For $900 ($1,200)

They all mean the same thing. It’s worth testing to see which one converts
better in your market.

Make The Contrast Huge. The value of the premium option comes from
huge differences with the decoy option. So make the decoy option as basic
as reasonable. Then make the premium option as awesome as possible. The
bigger the contrast, the better the deal, and the more customers will take it.

Discount Offers Have Higher Show-Up Rates Than Free Offers. In my
experience, If you run a Free Attraction offer, you’ll get more leads. If you
run a Discount Offer, you’ll get fewer leads, but a higher percentage will
show up. So if you have low show-up rates for appointments, try a Discount
Offer instead. This is especially important for businesses where you have a
high cost of someone not showing up (think doctors, lawyers, dentists, etc).

If Possible, Present The Premium Offer First. In a perfect world, they
take the premium offer immediately. The decoy offer stays in your back
pocket. If they come in specifically asking for the decoy option up front…

Get Them To Give You Permission To Sell Them. If they ask to hear
about your decoy, you are legally required to present it, or you prefer to
present it first, here’s how I like to do it:

Ask them a simple question: “Are you here for free stuff or lasting
results?”

And as soon as they say “results,” which most people do, skip to your
premium offer.

If they say “free stuff,” present the decoy offer then immediately contrast
it with your premium offer. Then only after presenting both, ask them
“which do you think will get you to your goal faster?” or “which would you
prefer: XXX less valuable benefit or YYY more valuable benefit 1, 2, 3…?”
At this point, they’ll have to say the premium offer. Then you can move
forward in the sale mutually agreeing it's the best thing for them.



When Making Your Premium Offer, Get Excited About It. Present it as
superior to the decoy offer, because it is. And, assuming it is, how it fits the
customer better. Your excitement motivates people to take the options that
will give them the most value.

From a selling perspective, you want to talk to the lead as if you already
know they will accept your offer. Many salespeople refer to this as an
“assumed close.” You operate from a position of: This is what everyone
does. This is just a formality. Let me get your ID and credit card so you can
get your value. No hype. Just friendly disposition. Almost bored over how
regularly people buy.

Surprise Benefit (Optional). To take this a step further, if someone takes
the decoy option, you can choose to surprise them with a few low-/zero-cost
features from your premium offer. Just say something like “hey, I’m gonna
throw this in, even though it's part of our premium offer just because I want
you to get great results.” This builds goodwill, over delivers, and increases
the chance they take your upsells later. Remember—they're still leads!

Summary Points

● Decoy Offers advertise something free or discounted. Then, when leads
ask to learn more,

you also present a more valuable premium offer.

● Make the premium option far more valuable than the decoy option by
adding more features,

benefits, bonuses, and guarantees.

● Strip down your Decoy Offer as much as reasonable.

● When leads ask about your Decoy Offer, present your premium offer
right next to it.

● Ask “are you here for free stuff or lasting results?” for permission to
offer the premium thing first.



● You can still make money from leads who pick the decoy option.
You’ll learn the best way to

deliver your decoy product and maximize upsells from it.

● Expect to make money fast. If you’re not, then make the contrast between
offers larger.



Buy X Get Y Free
Buy one puppy, get two puppies free!

 

Downtown Nashville 2020.

Bars and shops at this popular tourist destination went in and out of
business all the time, but one store reigned supreme: Boot Factory. Their
neon sign cut through the visual clutter on the street like a hot knife through
butter. A cowboy boot bigger than my car—directing me to the front door.
There was no mistaking what they wanted me to do. So of course, I obeyed.
And as I got closer, I could make out their offer:

BUY 1 PAIR GET TWO PAIR FREE



 

A decade passed since I’d been to Nashville. But, I remembered the sign
and the buy-one-get-two-free offer like it was yesterday. As a kid on bar
crawls, I thought the offer was dumb. “How could they give away so much
stuff and stay in business?” But now, with some offer-making under my belt,
I could appreciate it.

I went straight to the men’s section and grabbed a boot. Curious, the price
was marked down twice—to a “final offer” of $600 for the pair. But these
were normal-looking boots? The young me would’ve scoffed. But business
me realized I had missed something. The store got much bigger since the last
time I saw it, so the offer clearly worked. Then it clicked.

They charged three times the price for a single pair of boots because they
came with two more pairs. So rather than saying “come to Boot Factory and
buy boots at a fair price” they managed to create a free offer! Even in the
few minutes I checked out the store, bachelorettes filed in to get matching
boots. And since the Boot Factory sat in the middle of a street full of
cowboy-themed bars, this happened a lot. It was brilliant.

Description



In Buy X Get Y Free Offers, when customers buy something, they get
other stuff free. The more free stuff they get, and the higher its value, the
better it works. Free offers get way more attention than Discount Offers. But
if you only have one thing to sell, and you give it away, you go hungry. In
situations like this, businesses tend to lean on discounts. They run “sales”
relying on holidays, seasonal changes, or whatever, as reasons to temporarily
lower prices and get more customers.

But, by selling more than one thing at once, you can turn Discount Offers
into even stronger Free Offers. When you have more than one item, you can
make the discount value large enough that it covers the price of more stuff.
For example, I could sell three t-shirts for $10 each for a total of $30 or I
could sell one t-shirt for $30 and give two away free. It’s the same price, but
way more free stuff!

 

And if I wanted to offer a discount (rather than only reframe the price) I
could do this. I could sell three t-shirts for $6.67 each for a total of $20 (33%
discount) or keeping the same discount, I could sell one t-shirt for $20 and
give two away free. It’s the same price, but way more free stuff again!



 

Boot Factory took the first option. They tripled the price of one pair of
boots and added value…in more boots. And an expensive pair of boots with
two free pairs gets Boot Factory more customers than selling one pair at a
fair price. Plus, if you can include free then it attracts even more customers.

Examples

Buy 1 Get 2 Free Physical Products Offer: (The Boot Factory Offer)

● One Pair of Boots: $200

● Buy X Get Y Free Offer: Buy One Pair For $600, Get Two Pairs for
Free

● End Result: They still buy three pairs of $200 boots for a total of
$600

3 Versions: 18 Months Of Services AKA “3 Pairs Of Boots”

Good: “Buy 12 Months Get 6 Months Free” - $1,800

Better: “Buy 9 Months Get 9 Months Free” - $1,800

Best: “Buy 6 Months Get 12 Months Free” - $1,800



Everyone pays the same price for the same amount of service. But, the
third option is the most compelling. (Hint: It has the most free stuff!)

Important Notes

Buy X Get Y Free Gets People To Buy More Stuff And Provides More
Value. It used to take a whole year for some of my service businesses to
make their money. But the “Buy 6 Months Get 6 Months Free” offer
attracted far more customers than the original month-to-month offer. Even
better, they got paid up front for it!

Raise Prices Before Giving Stuff Away To Preserve Profits. If you use
this to attract customers, it will work. And since it will work, you need to
make money. So, permanently raise prices to accommodate the discount.
Don’t lie. Actually raise your prices. Since this is what all new customers
will be coming in on, then it makes sense to change it, for a season at least.
Plus, plenty of people might still take your doubled prices a la carte and
break your limiting beliefs around pricing. You're welcome.

Buy X Get Y Free Works Better If You Have More Free Stuff Than
Paid Stuff.

 

See second example. Buy ten get two free is not as strong as buy two get
ten free. This seems obvious, but again, people don’t do it. To make it work
better, give more free than you ask people to buy. Just play with the pricing
until it makes sense for you. ‘Buy one get two’ instead of ‘buy two get one’.

The Free Things Can Be Different From The Paid Things.



 

When people first start doing offers like this, they match the free and paid
stuff. But you can mix and match whatever you want. Just make sure the
value of the different free stuff still makes the offer compelling. Ex: Let’s say
socks have a $10 value. If they buy one shirt for $10 but get $20 of free
socks, it may seem like a better deal.

More Free Cheaper Things Can Work Better Than Fewer Free
Expensive Things.

 

Revisiting the t-shirt example. Let’s say I could only afford to give one
shirt away for free, but for the same cost I could give them three pairs of
socks. I’d probably test “Buy 1 Shirt Get 1 Shirt Free” against “Buy 1 Shirt,
Get 3 Socks Free.” Socks cost less than a shirt but people still see “buy one
thing get three things free.” Sometimes, more cheaper things work better
than fewer expensive things.

Rather Than Offer a 33% Discount, Try Buy One Get Two Free.



 

Even though it can be structured to accomplish the same thing, free drives
more interest than a discount. More people know the value of free than the
value of one shirt. For example, rather than sell $10 shirts for $6.67 each
(33% off), you may get more interest (and make more money) by offering
“buy one shirt for $20 get two free.” Test it.

Do Not Make Offers Like This If You Can’t Manage Money. While
Buy X Get Y Free offers create massive cash flow for a business, you need
to deliver. So if you get a whole year’s worth of payments in a month, make
sure you can deliver for the whole year. Budget the correct amount of money
to service your customers for the duration of your agreement. Don’t be a
goon and buy yourself a house with the cash meant for servicing your
customers. Selling stuff you can’t deliver on breaks the law and ruins your
reputation. Deliver on your promises.

Make This Offer To Existing Customers For Fast Cash. If you have a
recurring business already, and need cash fast, you can make this offer to
existing customers. Many will happily ‘Buy Ten and Get Two Free’ even at
their current price. Just limit the offer to 10% of your customers. This gives
you a good cash pop and keeps recurring cash flow healthy.

Don’t Worry. Prepaid Customers Keep Buying Stuff. So, Keep Selling
It To Them. A lot of people don't want to make more offers to customers
who prepay for stuff. This is a mistake. Speaking from experience, these are
people who spend the most money. Give them other offers to buy, and they



will. After all, they may have prepaid months ago. Their wallets have been
‘refreshed’ with new money that is dying to make it into your pocket. Don’t
get in the way!

If Customers Only Buy Once, Make Them Buy Big. The Boot Factory
in my story catered to tourists that want to fit in the local cowboy bars. This
means most of their customers made one purchase. Ever. For that reason, it
makes sense to make that purchase as large as possible. Just provide the
value to back it up. If you only have one shot, you may as well make it
count!

Summary Points

● In Buy X Get Y Free Offers, when customers buy something, they get
other stuff free.

● Buy X Get Y Free works for stuff that makes sense to buy more of or
get longer access to.

● Basic Buy X Get Y Free offers reframe pricing. Buy 1 Get 2 Free
costs the same as buying

3…except customers see the free offer as more valuable. (18 Months of
Service example)

● Always try to give more free things than paid things.

● You can pair different free things with your paid things.

● Some Buy X Get Y Free offers discount the price—where buying
more things costs less per

thing than buying the same number of things one at a time.

● Buy X Get Y Free can lengthen the amount of time customers stay. If
normal customers stay

for three months, then ‘Buy 2 Get 2 Free’ will keep them for four months
(or whatever you



set it at). This gives you more opportunities to make more offers and
provide more value.

● If you use Buy X Get Y Free to generate a lot of cash fast, make sure
you manage it well and

deliver on your promises.

● If you need fast cash, you can make this offer to existing recurring
customers. Just cap how

many you sell so you still have cash flow.

● Keep selling customers who prepay long durations, they are the most
likely customers to buy

again!



Pay Less Now or Pay More Later
Time is money. - Benjamin Franklin

 

June 2016.

A headline caught my attention: “Double your reading speed in 3 hours,
or it’s free.” I opened and scanned the text. Inside, the world’s fastest reader
offered a free training to double my reading speed in three hours. So, I
registered. Why not?

The registration page said, “You can put your credit card down for $0, and
get billed $297 tomorrow. And if your reading speed doesn't double, just
email us before then and we’ll cancel the charge. But you must attend in
order to be eligible.” or “You can just pay $97 right now, and as a free
bonus, get the recordings, which won’t be for sale anywhere else.”

I decided on the first option. I wanted to see if my reading speed doubled
before paying for anything. The whole training I expected him to sell me



more stuff. But he simply provided value. After two hours, using his tactics,
my reading speed doubled. Impressive. The training had been true to the
promise. He earned his $297.

After that, he talked about how I could learn to read even faster with his
eight-week training program. I was satisfied with my results, so I chose not
to take the upsell. He taught me a skill I still use to this day. But, the true
value came from learning a brand new Attraction Offer.

Description

In Pay Less Now or Pay More Later, you give people a choice to pay full-
price later OR pay a discounted price now. This play works so well because
we remove all risk from the customer. They pay later and only if they like it.
So it combines the benefits of a delayed payment and a satisfaction
guarantee. Anyone can sell this. Almost anyone will agree to pay later if they
are satisfied. But, once they agree to pay later, you can get them to pay now
with hefty discounts and valuable bonuses.

The pay later option allows you to advertise “free” since they can choose
to pay or not. This gets lots of leads engaged. But this free offer has an
added benefit—we get their card on file. If they choose this option and hate
the product, then they can cancel any time before the charge goes through.

If they accept the pay later option, we make a follow up offer to pay now.
Pay now options provide a 20–50% discount and greater bonuses. And since
we already have their card on file, we make it easy for them to pay.

Whether they choose to pay now or pay later, you’ve got customers, and
likely, some profit. But, to take full advantage of this offer, you’ll want
something else to sell. So have something more, better, newer to offer when
the time is right. And don’t worry, we go deep on upsells in the next section.

Examples

Find Your First Real Estate Deal—Free 3-Day Workshop

Pay Later: $0 for 3-day workshop. They get billed $500 at the end unless
they cancel.



Pay Now: $299 for 3-day workshop plus recordings, 1–1 call with
certified distressed

property expert, plus printed materials to use (delivered at the workshop).

Upsell: $30,000 to take you through every other step of closing your first
deal within six

months plus: legal templates, advisor to vet the investment, inspection
checklist, etc.

Local Business Service: Trim Your Hedges For Free

Pay Later: $0 Lawn Cut + Hedges then $599 after.

Pay Now: $369 Lawn Cut + Hedges + Lawn Treatment.

Upsell: $199 per month lawncare services.

The rep comes to the house, makes the estimate, and offers both options,
then upsells after

the work is done.

Physical Products: 14-Day Clothing Trial

Pay Later*: $0 Now. Get it. Then get billed $149 in 14 days.

Pay Now: $97 for the clothing + an accessory that goes with it.

Upsell: The dress comes with an offer for a monthly subscription to more
clothes like this.

*Customers must return the product in like-new condition before billing to
qualify for guarantee.

Important Notes

Promise A Clear Yes/No Result. First, make your promise a clear ‘yes or
no’ result. Second, make sure you can deliver on it within your time frame.



If you don’t, they will ask not to be billed. Duh. For example, if you promise
to decrease someone’s shoulder pain, have them rate their pain 1–10 before
you do your magic, then ask them to rate it after. If it went down, you’ve
succeeded and you can sell them something else. Keep the promise simple,
clear, and measurable. This avoids unnecessary cancellations.

Make a Conditional Satisfaction Guarantee. People can only cancel the
billing if they qualify. For example, I had to show up to the reading training
to qualify to cancel the charge. After all, they can't say you suck if they
never try it. So, be sure to track the conditions necessary to qualify. Think:
attendance, showing up to an appointment, turning in data, etc. Make the
criteria what people do to get the most value out of the product. Win-Win.

Bonuses For Your ‘Pay Now’ Option. I hate when people repeat content
and call it new. So I didn’t want to be like that. I dedicated an entire chapter
to bonuses in my offers book: $100M Offers. You can grab a copy of the
book, or watch the video training on my site for free at:
acquisition.com/training/offers.

Optimizing Your ‘Pay Now’ And ‘Pay Later’ Offer. If too many people
take your ‘pay later’ option, discount the ‘pay now’ option more, add better
bonuses, or both. If too many people take your ‘pay now’ option, do the
opposite.

If More Than 10% Of ‘Pay Later’ People Cancel Their Payment. You
promised too much, the guarantee conditions are too low, or the price is too
high. Note: No matter how well you deliver, some people will cancel their
payment. That’s okay. Factor it in your costs of doing business and live your
life.

This Works For Recurring Revenue Businesses Too. You just give them
the option to pay a higher ongoing rate 30 days later or they pay less today
and keep the lower rate for good. Plus, add in some bonuses.



Summary Points

 

● Pay Less Now Or Pay More Later Offers give people a choice to pay
full-price later OR pay

a discounted price with additional bonuses…if they pay now.

● The Pay Later option has a delayed payment with a conditional
guarantee.

○ Have clear criteria to qualify for the guarantee and easy ways to
measure it. ○ If you can, align the criteria with what gets people
the most value from the product.

● The Pay Now option offers a 20–50% discount and bonuses if they
pay now.

○ Offer customers the pay now option after they accept the pay
later option. ○ If they choose pay now, they get the discount and
bonuses instead of the guarantee.



● Make your promise easy to track, difficult to refute, and a clear
yes/no result.

● If you have more than 10% canceling, you promised too much, the
guarantee conditions are

too low, or the price is too high.

○ Also, give extra attention to those who claim they haven't received what
was

promised before the cancellation deadline.

“I became a quadriplegic in 2018 and was living on welfare until I found
your content and book…I made $50,000 the following 12 months as a
freelancer.” - Danny W.

I have a question for you…

Would you help someone you’ve never met if it cost you nothing, but you
didn’t get credit?

Most people do, in fact, judge a book by its cover. So here’s my ask on
behalf of a struggling entrepreneur you’ve never met: Please help that
entrepreneur by leaving this book a review. Your review helps…

…one more small business like Bill’s provide for their community. In
Bill’s own words:“I opened a pizzeria in early 2022 shortly after finding
$100M Offers. Sales started slow, but we did it! After I read $100M Leads
we implemented many things like having customers donate to the local
foodbank for a chance to win free pizza for a year. I’ve lost count of how



many new customers we've gotten after doing these things for the
community. This absolutely proves this stuff works for any type of business.
Thank you!”

…one more entrepreneur like Thomas support their family. In
Thomas’s own words: “After ten years, I got laid off my 9–5 job. But then
I found your book and opened a tour guide business in Colorado. Fast
forward two years and we have 5 employees! I literally took what I learned
and built my dream. Now my kids and wife are happier than ever.”

…one more employee like Miguel’s have more meaningful work. In
Miguel’s own words: “I received the book as a gift and decided to pass it
on to my six employees. Since then, our business has undergone a
remarkable transformation and continues to grow on a monthly basis. Not
only that, but I also gave it to my independent contractor trainers. Thank
you.”

Your review helps…one more entrepreneur like Simon transform
their life. In Simon’s own words: “I'm just a normal guy from Germany
and I couldn't get a client to save my life. Then I bought $100M Leads.
After reading the Cold Outreach chapter I started the Rule of 100. I
expected to mayyybe get 1-2 clients...But then...I booked 8 meetings in 7
days...I closed 4 of them and earned my first 500€ from one of the clients. It
has been 3 months now and my career couldn't be better. Your book was the
only book I needed. I recommend it to everybody!!”

…one more entrepreneur like Alex get out of a hole. In Alex’s own
words: “I moved in with my girlfriend making less than $1,000 per month.
I bought $100M Leads and we applied EVERYTHING. 3 weeks later we
signed a client for over $2,000 a month. Then, three more! I owe you A LOT
more than what those books cost.”

Your review helps…one more entrepreneur like Mohan flee his
country and get out of debt. In Mohan’s own words: “As a struggling
Indian immigrant trying to get to Ireland. I made so little money I would die
before I paid off my debt. I tutored on the side where I could. Then I read
the $100M Offers and quit my job 11 days later. I did the same work but
learned how to make offers this time. Clients were happy to pay. Sometimes



even €1500 when I give some bonuses. I make a livable income now. And
finally found what I love to do. I moved to Germany now and my debt is
almost paid. Thank you, Alex.”

Attraction Offers Conclusion
Extra! Extra! Hear All About It!

 

The point of Attraction Offers is to turn strangers into customers. And, to
do it in a way that gets more cash up front. Ideally, we get enough cash to
cover the cost of the customer and the cost to deliver our thing multiple times
over. That way we can pay ourselves back and get our next customer.

I showed you the five most powerful Attraction Offers I’ve seen and used:
Win Your Money Back, Giveaways, Decoy Offers, Buy X Get Y Free, and
Pay Less Now or Pay More Later. I apply them at one time or another to
every business I own. They turned $1,000 into $10,000,000 in ten months
because when I got returns I kept doubling down. A Grand Slam Attraction
Offer changes your business (and life) forever.

After using Attraction Offers, we’ve got more customers. And now that
we got ‘em, we need to boost our 30-day profits by selling them more stuff.
This leads us to the next component of a $100M Money Model—Upsell
Offers: What to offer next.

Section III: Upsell Offers

Do you want fries with that? - McDonald’s Famous Upsell



 

With an Attraction Offer in place, you’ve got customers and cash. If we
did a good job, we've turned a profit too. Nice! Now we want to maximize
30-day profits. So what do we do? Answer: make more money. To do that,
we make Upsell Offers. And when it comes down to it, Upsells just mean
whatever we offer next.

How Upsells Work



When an offer solves a problem, another appears. You upsell the solution
to the problem your offer reveals. So, every offer opens the door to an
upsell…even upsells! Often, upsells make the majority of the profit. They
make or break a Money Model. Let me show you how much.

Let’s say a burger shop makes $0.25 in profit on a $2.00 burger. If it was
the only offer they had, they’d have to sell ~10,000 burgers a day to cover
costs and barely eek out a “living.” Good luck. But, they have more offers
beyond just the burger. They ask “Do you want fries with that?” If they say
yes, they profit another $0.75 and ask “Do you want to make it a meal?”
which adds a drink. If someone says yes, they profit an extra $1.75. Their
profit goes from $0.25 to $2.00—an 8x increase. And on top of that, they
offer a third upsell “Do you want to supersize your meal for just a buck
more?” This takes profit from measly $0.25 to a massive $3.00—a 11.6x
increase. And now this little burger place actually has a chance at
succeeding.



 

I show this basic (and common!) example to point out one thing—your
first offer doesn’t always make the profit. In other words, the thing you sell
the most isn't always the thing you make the most profit on. You make it on
the second, third, and in the case of the burger business, fourth offers and
beyond. If McDonald’s didn’t upsell fries and soda, there wouldn’t be a
McDonald’s. If you want to win, you have to figure out your version of “Do
you want fries with that?” If you don't, others will.

Upsells fail when:

● You offer something they don't want (too different or doesn't solve
their problem).

● You offer it at the wrong time (before they’ve experienced the
problem).

● You offer it the wrong way (they don't believe you).

● Or, a combination of the above.



In summary, Upsells tend to offer:

● More of what they just got (think quantity)—Why have one burger
when you can have two?

● Better versions of it (think quality)—Why have mystery meat when
you can have sirloin?

● New or complementary stuff (think different)—Do you want fries and
a soda with that burger?

I Use Four Simple And Brutally Effective Upsell Offers:

● The Classic Upsell

● Menu Upsells

● Anchor Upsells

● Rollover Upsells

And with just a few tweaks, you can fit them into your business today.
Warning: This section is brutally effective and must be used ethically. That
being said, let’s make some money.






The Classic Upsell
You Can’t Have X Without Y!

 

Summer 2016.

He was a premier fur coat dealer, a fourth-generation business savant, and
a childhood mentor of mine. We sat down to catch up in a swanky restaurant
across from his shop. Within a minute of ordering, our salmon appeared.

“What do you think this salmon costs the restaurant? Three bucks? Maybe
a few extra pennies for the garnish? And look at the menu—they’re charging
thirty-two bucks! Unbelievable…but…we pay it.” He took his first bite,
chuckled to himself, then continued.

“So I heard you got into the game—good for you. Never would’ve
guessed when you worked at the shop. You were kinda awkward.”



“What can I say? Brushing seven thousand fur coats in a row melted my
brain.” I chuckled, “You still making a killing on that?”

A sheepish grin appeared. “Yeah. And that’s not even the best part, my son
came up with something genius.” His son would be the fifth-generation
owner.

“Tell me about it.” I asked.

“We advertise free earmuffs with coat storage. And get this. When
customers come to get their muffs and store their coats he says, ‘Great. And
we’ll store those as well for $30. You don’t want to store anything else do
you?’ And of course, they say no.”

“Wait a second, so you get them to pay for additional storage for the free
ear muffs by getting them to say no? You guys are legends.”

“Oh us? Noooo. We just stay creative…and if something works, we stick
with it.” ***

Whenever he talked business, he’d light up. Despite being awkward
around his shop, I learned many lifelong lessons from him. I share this story
in homage to those lessons.

Description

The Classic Upsell offers a solution to the customer’s next problem the
moment they become aware of it. I explain the Classic Upsell first because
it’s extremely profitable, easy, and anyone can do it. Main reason: current
customers always have a higher chance of buying your stuff than strangers.
And, when timed right, customers upsell themselves.

The Classic Upsell relies on knowing more about your customer’s
problem than they do. And you darn well should—it’s your business after all.
The idea is simple—your core offer solves one problem and creates another.
Your upsell immediately solves that next problem. This gives the classic
upsell its “You can’t have X without Y” structure. Like the rental car story.
You can’t have a car without insurance. You can’t have a car without gas.
You can’t have a good trip without a late checkout. Etc. And all of these



things become immediately apparent as soon as the customer makes the first
purchase.

Bottom Line: If a problem appears, and you can solve it immediately—in
exchange for money—do it!

Examples

Local Car Wash Service

First purchase: Car Wash

Upsell: Sealant

You’re not gonna wanna do the wash without sealant. You get way more
for your money.

Physical Product

First Purchase: Bicycle

Upsell #1: Helmet

Upsell #2: Lights

Upsell #3: Puncture-Resistant Tires

You can't have a bike without a helmet!

Digital Product

First purchase: Course on exercising

Upsell: Nutrition course

You can’t out-exercise a bad diet…so you’re gonna want our course on
nutrition.

Important Notes



Actually Do It. You’d be amazed how many businesses come to me and
only sell one thing. I usually just tell them “You barely have a business—
you have a front end. Figure out what you’re gonna offer next.” Months
later, I hear they actually 5x’d their business because they actually offered
an upsell.

Offer More Profitable Upsells First. If I offer two products and one has
a higher profit than the other, I offer the higher profit option first.

Get Them To “Say No To Say Yes.” I was always amazed at how often
the fur coat dealer got people to buy stuff by saying “no.” He knew people
had been trained to say “no” in response to “you don't want anything else do
you?” But this actually turns a “no” into “yes.” So when upselling, the
question translates to: You don’t want anything [besides what I just offered]
do you? Clever salesmanship. So let the nos (yeses) roll in.

Surprise And Delight. Let’s say you have four bonuses you save to add
to get people who are on the fence to buy. Add one at a time. If they say yes
before you add them, still give them all four. It will surprise and delight
them. And, it guarantees you still sell the same thing to everyone so no one
feels left out later.

Sell More When They’re Buying More—Hyper Buying Cycle. Most
buyers enter a “hyper buying” cycle when they decide to do something new.
It’s a short window of time when they are the most excited about a new thing
they’re gonna do. This is when they spend a huge chunk of money in a short
period of time. Think weddings, starting new hobbies, having babies,
moving to new places, and so on. If you have a business that caters to these
sorts of problems, don’t shy away from Upsell Offers. Embrace it...and keep
making offers.

Use Free Bonuses To Create Problems Upsell Offers Solve. Bonuses
solve problems. That’s what makes them valuable. And because of the
problem-solution cycle, they can also reveal them. Upsells can solve that
new problem. The ear muffs, for example, cost materials and labor. But they
were able to ‘give them for free’ by getting customers to pay $30 to store
something they just got for free.



The Faster People Get Access To Stuff, The More They’ll Value It. A
$10,000 thing you get later is worth less than a $10,000 thing you get now.
The longer it takes someone to access something, the less value it has in the
moment. So if you want to raise the chance of them taking the upsell, make
it available as soon as you can. Bonus points if you put it in their hands
before they’ve said yes. It’s way harder to give something back than it is to
say no.

If You Bundle Upsells, Name Them. It’s easier to sell someone one thing
than nine things. By bundling items together, you can make one ‘ask’ and get
nine sales. I name the packages based on customer type and/or result. For
example, “Fastest results” bundle or “Transformation package” or
“Minimum package.” All of these will boost upsells-per-person. Last, you
can “peel” some of the products or features out of the package as a way to
downsell. More on that in Section IV: Downsell Offers.

Integrate Upsells Into Your Other Offers. Make stuff you upsell part of
how you deliver other offers. Then, more customers will take them. My meal
plans included optional supplement suggestions. So when I went over
nutrition, people asked about supplements. Gym Launch sales and marketing
training suggested optional softwares. This led gym owners to buy them.
Integrate the next thing you wanna sell into the first thing they buy.

Make Sure You Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting (BAMFAM). The
more times you can upsell, the more people you will upsell. If you upsell
more people, you make more money. Since you want that…end every
appointment by scheduling the next appointment. Don’t let them leave
without booking! As my big fancy public CEO friend Sharran says: “A
customer should know the next time they see you—and why—before they
leave.” So if you agree to meet again, agree on why and when right then.

Upsell As Many Times As It Makes Sense To. The rental car agency had
lots of upsells. The burger place had lots of upsells. My gyms had lots of
upsells. Gym Launch had lots of upsells. Offer as many solutions as there
are problems you can solve. Don’t be shy. If you can solve it, offer to. The
second worst thing that happens is they say no. The worst thing is if they
would've said yes but you never asked.






Upsell Guarantees, Warranties, and Insurance. Many businesses offer
guarantees on products. Many businesses offer warranties on products.
Many businesses offer insurance on products. You can upsell all of them. So
instead of doing it for free, just add 5–50% onto the price in exchange for a
guarantee that your thing does what you say it will. Ex: An art studio used to
replace damaged portraits at no charge. I told them to start asking customers
if they would pay an extra 10% for it. Now, 30% of customers buy stuff the
art studio used to give away for free. Pure profit baby.

Summary

● Your Attraction Offer reveals a problem. Upsells (whatever you offer
next) solves it.

● Use The Classic Upsell for immediate problems revealed by your
previous offer.

● Asking “you don’t want anything else do you?” gets people to agree
by saying no. It works.

● Increase the chance customers take upsells by giving them access to it
as soon as possible.

● Give away bonuses that create an upsell opportunity. A great way to
make more cash.

● To get more chances to upsell customers, make BAMFAM a way of
life.

● You can have as many upsell offers as you want as long as you solve
problems.

● You lose nothing by offering to solve someone’s problem.

● If it makes sense for your business, you can charge for guarantees,
warranties, or insurance

rather than give them away for free.






Menu Upsell
You don’t need that…you need this

 

December 2013.

People kept joining the gym like normal, but nobody cared about my
supplements. I read somewhere keeping shelves full got more people to buy.
So I stocked my shelves with all the labels in a perfect row. It didn’t work. I
also read if I told everyone about the cool science they would buy. That
didn’t work either. I got a few pitty purchases from loyal members, but I was
doing something seriously wrong. Why do I suck so much?



On a particularly rough day, I had nineteen nutrition consults, and nobody
bought anything. It was miserable. Then, appointment number twenty came
in. She had a nice purse and a big diamond ring on her hand. If I can’t sell
her, I should just quit trying. But then I remembered…I’ve got $5,000 in
inventory on that shelf—I’ve gotta figure this out!

We went through her nutrition consultation and I started getting nervous. I
got so nervous I forgot my script. And rather than blabbing about science
stuff, I just asked “You’ve got a protein shake for breakfast, do you like
chocolate or vanilla?”

“Which one’s your favorite?” She asked.

“Chocolate.”

“Great. I’ll take one of those.”

Wait, what just happened? I didn't talk about the benefits or anything. I
just asked what she wanted…and she told me! Taking the hint, I moved to
the next item.

“Do you want kiwi or strawberry lemonade pre-workout?”—then I
remembered her last question—“...I like strawberry lemonade.”

Smiling, “Great, I’ll take that one.”

I had more products, but selling two was a record and I didn’t want to
scare her away. I still had to ask for money. So I grabbed her membership
contract that already had her card on it and asked “You just wanna use the
card we have on file?”

“Yep—that’s fine.”

After that conversation, I sold the next twenty customers in a row. At the
end of the day, I stared at my empty shelf in disbelief. I know how to sell
supplements.

Takeaway: I stumbled on two tactics that changed my upsell game
forever. First, the A/B Upsell—I ask which product they prefer rather than



whether they want the product at all. Second, asking if they want to use the
card on file rather than asking them to take out their card again. I still use
both to this day.

August 2014.

Now, I closed sales left and right. Bing bang boom. Now it wasn’t exactly
big stuff, but I was selling consistently. Every month I’d start another group
of challengers. And like clockwork, I’d upsell $5,000 to $10,000 worth of
supplements. Not bad for a day’s work!

But one day, I had a lady who just wouldn’t stop asking questions. She
kept wanting more information. How to take them. How many. When. What
times. What if she was working. What if she was at home. What if she was at
the gym. She was relentless. I was gonna be late for my next consult. So
finally, I just wrote step-by-step instructions on the back of some scratch
paper. Take one of these at night. Take two of these after lunch. Drink this
after your workout. Yada yada yada.

I walked her through what I wrote and asked. “Make sense?”

Nodding. “Thanks!” She grabbed the paper and left.

My next appointment had overheard our entire conversation. As soon as
she sat down, she asked “do you think you could write it out like you did for
that other lady?” I tried not to let out a sigh—I failed. I was gonna be late for
my next consult again.

But, I did as she asked. This time, I wrote the instructions right on the
order form. Next to each item, I wrote how much to take and when. And
because I didn’t want to push my appointments back another fifteen minutes,
I just went for the upsell.

“I got all your instructions here, do you want to just use the card on file?”
I asked.

“Yea that’s fine.”



Hot diggity dawg. She just bought all those products…and I didn’t even
ask her anything. I told her. And she did it. Like magic.

I did this from that day forward, and my 30-day profits skyrocketed.

Takeaway: I learned detailed and personalized instructions upsell more
people than vague and general suggestions. I call this prescription upselling.

November 2016.

By now, I was on the road launching other people’s gyms. And that
included selling supplements. I sold thousands of people. I’d see 40 to 50 a
day. Two people. Every 30 minutes. 12 hours straight. My supplement-
selling marathons alone covered the flight there, my hotel and advertising
costs. I got so good I’d run out of stuff to sell. Today was one of those days.

I just sold a lady the last of four different products. In situations like this,
I’d sell whatever I had left to the next customer. But before I could pitch, she
blurted out, “Can I just get what she got?” Oh boy.

I said “Sorry, I just ran out. But honestly, you can get something close at
the shop down the street for about $20 less. It’s not as good, but it'll do OK
for the first month. Cool?”

“Thank you so much for helping me out.” She seemed so grateful. It felt
good. So I continued unselling.

“This other thing, same story. Again, not as good, but it'll get you through
the first month.” She seemed so happy. I couldn't stop myself now. I started
unselling stuff I wasn't going to sell her anyways.

“You’re not trying to gain weight, right?” I joked.

“Oh god no!” she laughed.

“Okay great. You won't be needing this,” crossing out the weight-gainer
shake. “Oh, and you aren't trying to boost your testosterone right?”

“No haha. I don't think so,” she said.



“Great. You won't be needing this either.” I crossed it out. Then, I started
making suggestions from what I had left. “Okay. So you’re gonna need to
take two of these…three of these…” and I went on. She loved it and bought
without hesitation.

Takeaway: I went out of my way to cross out what she didn't need. And
this built enough goodwill to upsell what she did. Later, I kept products just
to cross them out! I call this process unselling.

Description

In a Menu Upsell, you tell customers which options they don’t need.
Then, tell them what they do need, their preferences, and how to get their
value from it. Menu Upsells combine up to four tactics: Unselling,
Prescription Upselling, A/B Upselling, and Card On File.

First, I unsell what customers don't need.

Second, I prescribe what they do need.

Third, I ask their preferences between A and B.

Last, I make buying easy by asking if they want to use the card on file.

Unselling. You unsell by telling customers what they don’t need so that
you can emphasize what they do. Here, instead of asking if they want to buy
it or not, you explain what they don’t need as a way to get them excited
about what they do. Unsells vary based on the customer’s needs. When
some options work best, you can cross out the rest. After telling them what
they don't need…

Prescription Upsell. We tell them what they do need. Prescription Upsells
work well when offering a choice is inconvenient and you have only one
thing that solves the problem. Prescription upselling has two important
components. First, you have to explain how it integrates with offers they
already bought. Second, you personalize and detail how to maximize its
value. Here, instead of asking if they want to buy it or not, you explain how
to use it as if they already have. Again, we remove the option of not buying



to lower the chance they don’t buy. And once I have told them exactly how
they’re going to use everything…

A/B Upsell. We ask them their preferences. A/B Upsells work for multiple
offers that solve the same problem. You make A/B Upsells by asking their
preference. Instead of asking if customers wanted to buy a product, yes or
no, we ask which product they prefer: A or B. Either choice results in an
upsell. Basically, when you give people the option to not buy, some don’t
buy. So, I give the option to pick between buying two similar things. Once
they know what they're buying and how they're gonna use it, I suggest the
easiest way for them to pay…

Card On File. A cherry on top of all this upsell goodness. I literally ask,
“Do you want to use the card on file?” Here, instead of asking if they want
to pay or not, you refer to ways they already have. This gets more people to
buy because it lowers the “hidden costs” of buying. Picking which card to
use. Taking it out. Being reminded of ugly buying decisions in the past. Even
the hassle of buying stuff in a rush…and who knows how many more. Just
know if you make it easy for people to buy, more people will.

This took me ten years to learn. May you get the same value in ten
minutes.

Examples

Massage Therapist

● Unsell: We have a lymphatic massage available, but you’re not
pregnant or just out

of surgery right? So we can cross that out.

● Prescribe: Since your shoulder hurts we’ll heat you up first, then hit your
trigger points, and

after that, we’ll do some dynamic stretches.

● A/B: So would you rather do it before work or on the way home?



● Card On File: Wanna just use the card on file?

Dog Food

● Unsell: You’re not gonna need this small bag or this puppy stuff—
you’ve got a big dog! You

don’t need these vitamins either because the food already contains them.

● Prescribe: You’re also gonna wanna give your dog one of these joint
chews at each meal. And

every 90 days, give them one of these wafers for heartworms. Also, make
sure to bring him

back next month. Let’s get that booked now.

● A/B: So does your dog prefer beef or chicken flavor?

● Card On File: Wanna just use the card on file?

Digital Product

● Unsell: You don’t need all eight courses yet. You just need to solve X, Y,
& Z. Tell ya what.

I’ll send you some free stuff that’ll solve problems X and Y. Then, you’ll
just need one

course for problem Z…

● Prescribe: But to solve Z, you’re definitely gonna wanna do the
course this particular way. Can

you put an hour a day towards it? Okay—great. This will prevent any
other Z problems

cropping up later.



● A/B: Would you rather have direct message or phone support? Okay
great. And would you

like to start today or Monday?

● Card On File: Awesome. Wanna just use the card on file?

 

Important Notes:

Make Anything A/B Sellable. You can turn anything into an A/B offer.
Just to give you a few ideas…Quantity (do you want one bottle or two?),
start dates (start tomorrow or Monday?), payment preference (cash or card?),
flavors (chocolate or vanilla?), time slots (morning or afternoon?), media
(read or listen?), delivery speeds (standard or overnight?), sizes (small or
medium?), colors (black or white?), materials (paper or plastic?), personnel
(John or Sara?), communication (call or text?). With some creativity, you can
make anything an A/B upsell.

If You Make An A/B Offer, Add A Nudge. If your customers have
limited experience with your products or service, give them a nudge. “This is
my favorite” or “X is usually a safe bet” or “a lot of people love this” or
“Tuesday’s sessions are a little smaller if you like that” or “Amy does great
with high schoolers.” These one-liners really help move sales along. (Hint:
If you want to move one particular product faster, nudge that one more.)

If You’ve Sold Out Of It, Take Payment And Delay Delivery. Later I
learned I could just sell them stuff, order it, and set the expectation of when
it will arrive. This allowed me to sell way more selection because I didn’t
have to carry inventory. If you run out, consider just collecting the cash and
changing the delivery expectations. You’d be surprised how well this works.

Employees Love Unselling. Employees often like helping customers
“game the system.” Let them. Encourage employees to help customers game



the system on purpose. Your employees have inside knowledge, so allow
them to show customers how to get the most value out of what you have to
offer. Everyone wins.

See “The ‘Economist’ Play” below for a visual explanation.






Summary Points

● Menu Upsells work best when you have multiple offers available.

● Menu Upsells combine up to four tactics:

○ Unselling: You tell customers what they don’t need.

○ Prescribing: Tell them what they do need. ○ A/B Offer: Ask them what
they prefer. ○ Last, I make buying easy by asking if they want to use the

Card On File.

● Unselling lower-margin stuff where appropriate incentivizes higher-
margin upsells.

● Encourage employees to unsell and “game the system” on purpose.

● Nudge new customers towards what makes sense for them.



Anchor Upsell
The only thing worse than making a $1,000 offer to a person
with a $100 budget…

is making a $100 offer to someone with a $1,000
budget.

 

2016. After Starting Gym Launch, But Before Making Money.

I had spent my last five years showerless, in sweats and a tank top. But
now I had Gym Launch, and a fashionable friend said I should look
professional. “Businessmen don’t wear tank tops Alex. I know the owner of
a local suit shop. I’ll tell him you’re coming.” I took his advice and went.



So, I budgeted $500 for a suit—a big purchase at the time. I walked into
the suit shop and made small talk. The owner knew I was coming. Wow. I
told him I just started a new business and wanted a “boss suit.” He took my
measurements, then grabbed two suits off the rack. I put the first one on.

“How’s it look? How do you feel?”

I smiled. I felt cool. Like a rich guy. It was nice. He talked about some
accessories but I didn’t listen much. I was ‘too cool’ to listen now (ha!). This
is gonna be awesome. He turned to talk to an employee. I flipped the price
tag over so I could see it…

…$16,000. My face turned red. All I could think was my friend asked the
owner to make time for me and I can't even afford anything here. I felt
horrified. I kept my head down to try and hide my shock. I took a breath and
looked up. I failed. He had seen me blush.

Coming to my aid he asked “Do you care about the designer much?”

“Not at all.”

Almost before I finished replying, the owner whirled around and draped
the next suit over my shoulders. “Try this on for size.” he said.

I looked in the mirror. Looks good.

Then I looked down at the price tag…$2,200.

It wasn’t $500. But it wasn’t $16,000 either. Sigh of relief.

“Yea. This works. I'll take this one.”

He winked and nodded. “You got it boss.”

The owner sold me some socks, a handkerchief, and a shirt to go with it.
All in, another $300. But, after seeing the $16,000 price tag on the first suit,
everything seemed cheap. ***



Looking back, this wasn’t the owner’s first rodeo. He was a real pro. I
spent five times more than I had budgeted and felt OK about it. I only later
realized he used a Price Anchor.

Description

With Anchor Upsells, you offer premium stuff first. If the customer gasps,
you offer a cheaper but acceptable alternative.

Basically, if you present your main offer, some people will buy it. Duh.
But, if you present a premium version that’s 5x–10x the price first, lots of
people will say no. Then, when you present your main offer, it looks like a
much better deal. So, more people will buy it. Aha! That’s the power of
Anchor Upsells.

Anchor Upsells work best when the lower-price offer has the same core
functions as the premium one. For instance, I didn’t care about the designer
that much. I just needed a suit. So, compared to the $16,000 suit, the $2,200
suit was a way better deal.

Anchor Upsells also have two amazing bonuses. First, anchored
customers spend more than they normally would. Second, some customers
still buy the super expensive thing.

Here are the steps:

1. Present the Anchor—the really expensive thing.

2. Get “The Gasp”—expect the customer to freak out about the cost.

3. Come to the rescue—ask if they care about what makes it premium.

4. Present your main offer—expect the customer to feel relieved and
see the better deal.

5. Ask how they wanna pay—Which card do you prefer?



 

Examples

Local Service: Lawn Care

Premium Anchor: Get my cell phone number, fancy mulch, natural pest
control, bi-weekly

yard maintenance—$1,000 per week

Main Offer: Get my team’s number, generic mulch, normal pest control,
bi-weekly yard

maintenance—$200 per week

Physical Product: A Painting

Premium Anchor: Super protective packaging + 20 year insurance + gift
wrapped = $1,000

Main Offer: Normal packaging + 1 year insurance + sticker = $200

Digital Product: Newsletter



Premium Anchor: All previous issues + new issues + 24hrs early =
$199/mo

Main Offer: New issues only + on time = $19/mo

Important Notes

If You Treat The Anchor Like A Fake, So Will The Customer. Some
people hear about this technique. Try it. Gloss over the premium offer. And
then say it doesn’t work. But if you do that, then the person never really
considered it because you never really offered it. You went through the
motions. For this to work, you need to actually sell it and they have to
actually consider it. Only after they pause, hesitate, or ask for something
else, do you move to the next thing.

Make A Premium Offer You Actually Want People To Buy. A friend of
mine struggled to get this working. I only had to listen to one call to figure
out the problem. He made up some BS that he didn’t really want them to
buy. So we tweaked the offer to something he would actually feel happy to
deliver if someone paid…and they did. Tripling his profits. Actually present
your premium offer like you want people to take it. And when you do, some
will. And if they don’t, you still anchored them.

A Proper Anchor Gets “The Gasp.” When you do an anchor upsell
correctly, customers will have mini panic attacks. I call this “The Gasp.”
Gasps used to really stress me out. But then I realized something huge. The
bigger the gasp, the more they bought.

Once You Get The Gasp—Come To The Rescue. In the story, I gave
“The Gasp.” Then, the sales pro saved my ego by asking if I cared about the
designer. When I said no, he presented the next suit. Key point: he already
had the 1/8th price suit pulled before my reaction. He knew I would probably
gasp. And if your customers don’t gasp, then they probably find your
premium offer reasonable…so just ask them if they wanna use the card on
file (ha! Go for it!). Just don’t do a gasp of your own when they say yes.
You’re welcome. You can buy me a beer later.



To Get More People To Buy Your Main Offer, Make It A Better Deal.
Only tweak a few features from your premium offer to make your main
offer. Every offer has features. Some features matter more than others. You
want the primary features to stay the same. Fewer people care about
secondary features, so change those. This allows customers to get the same
primary features and a way better deal. Most people just want a suit. A few
people want a fancy suit. A suit is the primary feature. The material,
designer, etc. is secondary. After anchoring, offering the primary features for
a fifth of the price makes the main offer a great deal.

Summary

● If you present a more expensive offer before a less expensive offer,
more people will buy the

less expensive offer than they would have if you had presented the less
expensive offer on its

own.

● Present anchor. Get gasp. Come to the rescue. Present core offer. Ask
for payment.

● For the most effective anchor, make your premium offer 5–10x more
expensive.

● Anchored customers spend a bit more than they plan to.

● Don’t treat the anchor like a fake, or the customer will too. You lose
trust and waste time.

● Important: Some customers will buy the premium offer.

● Expensive premium offers add outsized profits with fewer sales.

● The main offer and the premium offer should have the same primary
features.



● The premium offer has different secondary—aka ‘premium’—
features.

● After anchoring, offering the primary features for a fifth of the price
makes the main offer a

great deal. It gives them ‘basically the same thing’ for way less.



Rollover Upsell
Wanna just roll it forward?

 

June 2014.

I had been running a Win Your Money Back Offer (Attraction Offer #1) at
my gym for the last year. A $600 fitness program where members could win
their money back—if they hit a goal. It crushed. I sold tons of them.

But there was a problem. Good gyms have lots of recurring revenue. I had
none. Most winners put their $600 toward three months of membership.
Fine. But then they churned out before their first out-of-pocket payment. So
I essentially sold “buy six weeks get three months free.” Then, they’d leave.
Not fine.

That $600 thing was my only source of income. So even though I got a
bunch of people in the door, my revenue started at zero every month. It was
stressful. I had to figure out a better way to boost profit.

That's when my friend Justin posted how he added another hundred
members to his recurring revenue. He also attracted customers with a Win
Your Money Back Offer. But there was one difference: my customers left,
and his kept buying stuff. So, I invited myself over to spy on him. He was
totally cool with it. I spent two days there. He and I ran some things



differently, but nothing that explained why he was doing so much better than
me.

“Do you get lots of people winning their money back?”

“Yeah,” he said.

“Then how do you deal with all the free time you have to give away?”

“Free time? Ha! I just roll over their winnings into a year long
membership.”

“What?”

“Yea—we have to do that so we can spread the money out.”

“Spread the money? What are you talking about?”

“Seriously? What—you give it all up front?” He didn’t wait for me to
answer. “We just give them fifty bucks off per month for a year.”

“So even though they won their money back, they start paying
immediately?”

“Of course. I don't want people not paying. What sort of business doesn’t
have paying customers??” He laughed. “They still get their money back…it
just takes a year.”

Boom. This was it. The missing link in my Money Model.

***

This one thing, the Rollover Upsell, changed my life, thousands of gym
owners' lives, and the lives of our customers. The Rollover Upsell changed
everything.

Now, instead of hoping customers spend money again, I roll over the cost
of what they just bought toward the next thing. And when paired with more
expensive offers, it skyrockets 30-day profits.



And although I learned the Rollover Upsell this way, you don’t need a
Win Your Money Back attraction offer to use it. You can Rollover Upsell
anyone anything. (Even stuff people bought at other businesses…mwahaha).

Description

Rollover Upsells credit some or all of a customer’s previous purchases
toward your next offer. And this—in my experience—gets way more people
to take it. So once I know how much credit to give, I figure out three things:
who to upsell, what to upsell, and how to roll over the credit.

For the who, I use Rollover Upsells in four situations:

First, to re-engage customers who left a while ago.

Second, to rescue upset customers as a better alternative to a
refund. Third, to ‘rescue’ other people’s upset customers.
Fourth, to upsell regular customers.

For the what, remember, you can upsell more of what they just got,
something better, or something new and different. To make money: Roll their
credit over to something more expensive.

For the how, you can apply all or part of the discount up front or spread it
over time.

Examples of Rollover Upsells

Chiropractor: Re-engage old patients with a “Winback” Campaign Who:
Customers With Six Months Since Last Purchase What: New Plan How: Up
front

Reach out to your old patients. Look at their purchase history. Offer to
apply some or all of their past purchases towards something more expensive
than what they bought.

Ex: “Hi Mrs. Banks, I wanted to give you your money back, do you have a
minute? Great, yea. I wanted to see how your back pain is going? Oh, I'm
sorry to hear that. Well, I have some good news. As a way of saying thank



you, I want to give you $500 of your money back as credit towards staying
pain-free for good. Is that of any interest? Great…let’s get you in…”

Dentist: Save Your Own Upset Customer With Rollover Upsell Who: Upset
Customer What: Teeth Whitening How: Front Load $200 Credit.

The person pays $200 for teeth cleaning but doesn't think their teeth got
whiter. We explain they need more to get more and upsell into a teeth
whitening package which includes multiple sessions, an at-home kit, and
multiple deep cleanings. You offer to credit the $200 they paid for the
cleaning towards the whitening package.

Software: Rescue (*Cough* Steal) Other People’s Upset Customers Who:
Competitors’ customers What: Service agreement How: Rollover cost to
break old agreement.

You find competitors’ upset customers and credit the customers’ old
purchases with them towards a new purchase with you. Roll over the amount
they owe with them as credit towards a longer agreement with you.

Ex: “Hi John, I saw your negative review on their product and it really
upset me. To make it up to you, I’ll credit whatever payments you have left
with them to switch to ours. This way, you don’t lose a thing and you start
getting the benefits now. Fair enough?”

Membership: Spread First Purchase Over a Term Who: Current customers
What: 12-month membership How: Spread out first purchase.

Somebody buys a small block of service or membership time. As soon as
they do, you can offer to apply the entire amount towards more time—like
12 months. I can do the rollover upsell at any time, I just prefer to do it right
then. When you do, you take the first purchase’s cost and apply it as a
discount over the longer agreement. For example, a $600 first purchase
makes a $50 per month rollover discount for 12 months.

Important Notes.

Use Rollover Offers To Attract New Customers. For example, you roll
over some or all of what customers paid somebody else towards your thing.



You can find leads for this by scraping contact information from negative
product reviews where available. Voila—a hot new list of leads who need
what you have. Bonus: Create a way for people to complain about products
in your industry (think any media where people can leave comments). Then,
Rollover Upsell all of them. Nasty.

Do Rollover Upsells before refunding. This has saved me tons of
customers and cash. If you did a bad job (hey, it happens), roll over for a ‘do
over.’ And if they want something different, roll over their purchase toward
that thing instead.

Previous Customers Are Still Customers. Upsell Them. Reach out to
old customers (6+ months since last purchase). Look at how much they paid
before. Decide how much you’re willing to roll over. Offer it. Actually do
this. I called these “winback campaigns.” I made personalized videos for 200
past customers offering them $4,000 of credit to return. We got about 20% to
take the offer. One day of recording videos got us an extra ~$1,900,000 of
annual revenue. Worth It.

Add Urgency To Rollover Upsells. Make Them One-Time Only. If
you’re spicy, make the moment you present the offer the time to take it. A
once-in-a-customer-lifetime offer. They don’t get to sleep on it. And yes, I
know they might not expect it. That’s the point! You want to surprise and
delight. So if they want the credit, they've gotta take it now. If not, no big
deal. They can still pay full price later.

How To Price Your Rollover Upsell. To make money on a discounted
offer, you must have profit left after you discount it. Since I prefer to make a
profit, I try to make the upsell offer at least four times more than their
rollover credit. So even if I apply the whole amount of the first purchase, it
discounts 25% at most. Remember, the rules of discounting apply. Bigger
discounts make you less profit per sale, but they get more sales.

You Don’t Need To Credit The Entire Amount Of Their First
Purchase. You can roll over as much or as little of the first purchase you
choose. I roll over whatever amount I think would incentivize them to buy
the next thing. Test to find the sweet spot.



Summary Points

 



● Rollover Upsells credit some or all of a customer’s previous purchases
toward your next

offer.

● To do Rollover Upsells, figure out who to upsell, what to upsell, and
how to roll credit over.

● Who to upsell: old customers, upset customers, other people’s upset
customers, current

customers.

● What to upsell: more of something, something better, something new
or different. Just make

sure you make a profit after applying the credit.

● How to roll credit over: Full or partial purchase price. Given up front
or spread out.

● Price your next offer at least 4x higher than the credit. This makes a
25% discount.

● To get more takers, add urgency. Make your Rollover Upsell a one-
time only offer.



Upsell Offers Conclusion
Solve rich people problems, they pay better.

 

Anytime you offer something next, you upsell. Upsells play a key role in
Money Models by getting more cash from customers faster than you
otherwise would have. And if your Attraction Offer already covers the costs
of getting customers and delivering—more money ain’t a bad thing.

I showed you the four most powerful Upsells I use: The Classic Upsell,
Menu Upsells, Anchor Upsells, and Rollover Upsells. They are core to my
business success. Upsells change everything. Many businesses go from
burning cash to printing it—overnight.

But, as you know, business isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. Sometimes,
people say no. This leads us to the next component of a $100M Money
Model—Downsell Offers: what to do when they say no…

Section IV: Downsell Offers

What to offer when they say no.



 

In the last section, we used Upsell Offers to get people to buy more stuff.
If we did a good job, we’ve turned a profit too. Another step forward!
Awesome…but what if they say no? → We downsell them.

Downselling tweaks the original offer to find the highest value solution
for the customer’s budget. So any offer you make after someone says ‘no’ is
a downsell.

I downsell in two ways. I change how they pay or what they get. For how
they pay, I balance how much they pay now with how much they pay over
time. For what they get, I change quantity, quality, or offer something
different.

First, we cover my rules of downselling—they apply to all my downsell
processes. Then, when we dive into individual offers, you can hit the ground



running and downsell like a pro.

The Rules of Downselling

 

 



Remember, They Said No To This Offer, Not All Offers. Sometimes (a
lotta times) people say no…and that’s OK. Just because they rejected this
offer does not mean they rejected you. It hurts when someone rejects you. I
get it. But see it for what it is—an opportunity to find out what they really
want, and profit from it. Instead of hiding your head in the sand, stand your
ground and make another offer. No means no for this thing, not no for
everything.

Downsells Are Trades. When downselling, you work with the customer
to find combinations of giving and getting until you get a match. If you’re
gonna give something, get something.

Personalize, Don't Pressure. Figure out what they like and don’t like.
Then, offer more of what they like and less of what they don’t—with a price
to match. You’re personalizing here. If someone refuses my large soda
upsell, I can offer alternatives. I could ask if they want a small, a juice, or a
coffee. Am I being offensive by asking? Absolutely not. In fact, if I can
better serve them, it would be offensive not to.

Offer The Same Things In New Ways. In a perfect world, you’ve got
tons of different things to sell so everyone buys something. In the real world,
you limit downsells to what you’ve got. Otherwise, you create a hundred
businesses’ worth of products (and problems). A silly choice. So just think of
downselling more like a hundred ways to offer the stuff you already have.

Don’t Drop Your Price Just To Get Somebody To Buy. First off,
dropping your price is not really downselling, it’s discounting. If someone
wants what you have, and just doesn’t want to pay the price—tough cookies.
On the other hand, you can offer them to pay less now and more money over
time—a payment plan. But, whatever you do, don’t change the price just to
get someone to buy because…

Customers Talk About Price. By all means, test prices. Plan to offer
your thing at a specific price, to a specific number of people, ahead of time.
That’s way different than charging somebody less in the moment just
because you felt scared of losing the sale in the moment. Customers talk. If
they find out someone got the same thing for less “just because”—you’ll



upset people. And it also becomes an ethical problem, at least to me. Avoid
it.

Next Up…

I use three simple and brutally effective downsell processes:

● Payment Plan Downsells (how they pay)

● Trial With Penalty (how they pay)

● Feature Downsells (what they get)

These downsell processes boost 30-day profit even further. They do it by
making even more sales when customers would have said no. And I love
them because with just a couple tweaks, you can fit them into your business
and reap the rewards today.



Payment Plan Downsells
How much can you put down today?

 

August 2013.

It was my first real month in business. I had exactly one month’s rent in
savings left to my name…and I had never gotten a stranger to give me
money. And now, I had to get dozens of strangers to give me money in the
next few weeks—just to keep the lights on.

I only made a few sales the first week. If I kept that up, it meant going
hungry very soon. I had nightmares about going back home a failure. The
idea was unbearable. I got desperate.



The next morning a lead walked in and I went through my normal pitch.
She said “I can't afford it.” Normally, I’d just give up. But, I really needed
the money. So in my desperation I blurted out “OK, when do you get paid?”

“The first.”

“Okay, just put half down now, and half when you get paid.”

“I can’t afford that either.”

“Okay—do you really wanna do this program?”

“Yeah, I do.”

“What if you do three payments and just put a third down today?”

“I still can’t do it.”

“Hmm… What can you do?

“Honestly, nothing. But I can pay for the whole thing on the first.”

My rent was due on the fifth. Bingo. “Sounds good. Just give me your
card and I’ll charge it on the second. That work?”

“Yea—great!”

Two weeks later. I ran the card. And it worked. My first ever payment plan
—a success. Hallelujah.

***

Payment Plan Downsells work no matter how many zeroes the price tag
has. I’ve made tens of millions of dollars with them and I still use them to
this day. But, payment plans are a gamble. So you have to know how to use
them. I know how to use them and I’ll show you exactly how.

Payment plans are a gamble because they can make money in one way,
but they can lose money in two. They make you more money when you get



more customers and those customers complete their payments. They make
you less money when people cancel before you turn a profit. You lose the
most when people who would have paid in full take a payment plan—and
cancel early.

This chapter maximizes how much money you make from payment plans
and minimizes the money you lose. I take the bet when I know I’ll win. With
this playbook, you can too.

Description

When most people think “downsell,” they think of a lower amount, lower
quality, cheaper, and so on. Fair enough. But I like to downsell by offering
the same product again. I know it sounds crazy, but hear me out. Instead of
offering a different thing, I spread the cost by charging some of it up front
and putting the rest into scheduled payments. I call this a Payment Plan
Downsell. Let’s go over how they work.

Many people reject offers because they “cost too much.” Sometimes true.
But in response to this, business owners and other sales professionals will
immediately discount or sell cheaper stuff just to get people to say yes.
However, a huge percentage of the time “it costs too much” really means
“this costs too much up front.” In other words, people think discounts work
because people pay less for the product. But when you peel it back a layer,
it's really because they pay less in the moment. So Payment Plans get the
best of both worlds. They get more buyers because customers pay less in the
moment. But they also boost your profits because customers still pay full
price over time.

My Payment Plan Downsell process takes up to seven steps. The process
shifts from getting paid more up front to more over time. I stop when they
buy. Here are the steps:

1. Reward for paying in full rather than punish for paying over
time 2. Offer 3rd-party financing, credit card, layaway options 3.
Offer half now, half later



4. Check to see if they still want the thing 5. Offer to split into
three payments 6. Offer evenly spread payments 7. Offer a Free
Trial

Let’s go through them in order.

Example Of Payment Plan Downsell Process

Step 1) Reward For Paying In Full Rather Than Punish For Paying
Over Time. If I take on the risk of a payment plan, I increase the price.
Normal businesses do it by charging interest. But, I do it by offering a
discount if they pay in full.

Think about how businesses normally charge interest—they basically
say…“It’s $10 if you get it right now, but it’s $15 if you pay over time
because we charge $5 in interest.” No fun.

Instead, I say “It’s $15…but it’s $10 if you prepay it. You save $5…that’s
what most people do.” To do this, I present the price with interest included.
Then, I offer prepayment as a way to get a discount. This way, we make the
offer friendlier and benefit from a price anchor. Same math, but feels better.

If they say no, I start downselling. But, even still. I try to get paid first…

Step 2) Offer 3rd-Party Financing, Credit Card, and Layaway
Options.

3rd-Party Financing: This means another company pays me now and the
customer has a payment plan with that other company. Car dealers do this all
the time. The dealer gets money from the financing company today, and the
customer pays the financing company tomorrow.

Note: It takes work to get 3rd-party financing set up. But, totally worth
the effort.

Credit Card: Just ask “would you rather I decide your payment terms or
you decide?” They say they’d prefer to decide. When they do, I tell them to
use a credit card. That way I get paid today and they can pay the credit card



company over time. It’s wild to me that this reframe works. But, it does. I
don’t judge, I do.

Layaway: Layaway means paying off the product before getting it.
Customers can make as many installments as they want. They can take any
reasonable amount of time to pay. But, they only get the product after
they’ve paid in full. This is by far the most flexible for them and lowest risk
for us.

If they say no to these, I move to step 3.

Step 3) Offer ‘Half Now, Half Later.’ I start by asking “When’s the next
time you get paid?” After, I ask “Wanna just put half down today and the
rest down when you get paid?” If they can’t do that, I ask “What’s the most
you can put down today?” When they offer an amount say, “Great. We’ll put
that down today and put the rest when you get paid. Fair enough?” I like
scheduling payments off of paychecks since most people get paid every two
weeks. This boosts 30-day profit way more than monthly payments.

If they can’t do those...I pause to make sure they actually want it.

Step 4) Check To See If They Still Want The Thing. No payment plan
will satisfy a customer who doesn’t want the thing. So, make sure the person
actually wants your thing before putting more effort into selling it. I might
say something like “Got it. So money is tight right now. Real quick. I want to
make sure. On a scale from 1–10 how bad do you wanna do this?” If they
say 8 or above, keep offering payment plans and say “Awesome. Don’t
worry. We’re gonna figure out a way to make this happen for you.” If they
say 7 or below, ask “Why not a 10?” and then, say something like “You’re
right. I think we may have something that could be a better fit for you.”
Then you sell them something different (Feature Downsells—a little later).

Step 5) Offer To Split Into Three Payments. If they said 8–10 on the
scale, I downsell from half down to a third down. I offer a three-payment
option: ⅓ now and ⅓ on the next two paychecks—or—⅓ now and ⅓ the
next two months.



Step 6) Offer Evenly Spread Payments. If they still can’t manage it, I
evenly spread payments over the rest of their service. For instance, Gym
Launch was sixteen weeks long, so I charged them each week (sixteen times
in total). If that still creates problems, I move to step 7.

Step 7) Offer A Free Trial. I offer Free Trials in a special way. So, I
dedicated the next chapter to it. But, the sale ends here. At least for now.

This Payment Plan Downsell process makes up to nine offers. And if you
think that sounds crazy, you're probably making way less money and serving
way fewer customers than you could.

Important Notes

“Seesaw” Downselling. If you prefer fewer steps, or have less
experienced salespeople, then you can use this payment plan downsell
process. Instead of asking for the full amount, just ask “Would you rather
have giant monthly payments or tiny ones?” They’ll say tiny. Then you say
“It normally costs XXX. And if you prepay it today, you get a huge discount
and zero monthly payments. That work?” This frames the payment plan as
negative and highlights the benefits of prepaying.

Then, if they say they can’t afford it, say the more they put down now, the
lower their monthly payments. “If you can’t afford it up front, I totally get it.
We’ll simply adjust the down payment until you get a monthly rate you like.”
This still incentivizes bigger down payments to get their monthly payments
lower. If they still say no, ask if they still want the product. If they do, pull
your chair to their side of the table and walk them through the options. The
sale becomes a team effort. Straightforward.

Payment Plans Have Built-In Upsells: Make periodic offers for the
original paid-in-full-discount during their payment plan. If they pay off the
balance, they can still get the original ‘prepay discount.’ This works
exceptionally well. Customers forget they have the option. So when we give
it to them, some jump at the opportunity. Also, give your sales guys the same
bonus to close the balance to incentivize follow up. And remember, if you
give people the option to pay slower, they will pay slower. If you incentivize



them to pay faster, they will pay faster. So if you want them to pay faster,
give them a good reason to.

Get Fewer Declined Payments. Align payment schedules with paycheck
schedules. If you charge on days people get paid, they have a higher chance
of paying. Also, people’s paychecks get deposited at different times, so if at
first it gets declined, run it a few times that day. I learned this strategy from
John (my early mentor). I often recoup a third of my declined payments by
adding this little process.

How To Make Sure Payment Plans Make You Money. After
implementing payment plans, your close rate should increase. Duh. But, if
the number of paid-in-fulls goes down, you have a problem. You’ve just put
people who would’ve paid in full on payment plans! So, you want to close
more appointments overall but with the same percentage of appointments
paying in full.

Ex: If I talk to ten leads, I might sell three. If I have a downsell, I might
sell three more (for a total of six). So, in the second scenario, I get my up
front cash from the first three and the payments from the second three. This
makes sure downsells properly increase your 30-day profits.

Another Reason To Start High Before Working Your Way Down.
Profitwell (a company that manages subscriptions) reported churn data from
14,000 businesses. They uncovered this valuable gem. Across all businesses,
the billing cadence affected monthly churn.

Monthly (12x per year) billing resulted in 10.7% monthly cancellation
rates.

Quarterly (4x per year) billing resulted in 5% monthly cancellation rates.

Annual (1x per year) billing resulted in 2% monthly cancellations.

I already present pricing in order of most cash up front to least. It just so
happens this also makes customers more valuable over the long term. So
start high (fewer bigger payments) and work your way down.



Bottom Line: Changing how customers pay can have a massive
difference in how long they stay. We go in more depth on continuity and
churn in Section V: Continuity Offers.

Summary Points

● Payment Plan Downsells spread the cost of a product by charging some of
it up front and

putting the rest into scheduled payments.

● Payment Plans get more buyers like discounts, but can also boost
profits because they agree

to pay the full price over time.

● Payment Plans only grow your business if they get more customers and
those customers

actually pay.

● Step 1) Present at full price then offer a discount if they pay in full.

● Step 2) 3rd-party financing, then credit card option, then layaway
option.

● Step 3) Split the payment in two. Schedule on their paycheck dates.

● Step 4) Ask if they still want the product on a scale of 1–10. You want
8 or greater.

● Step 5) Split the payment in three. Schedule on their paycheck dates
or monthly.

● Step 6) Schedule equal payments across a specified amount of time.

● Step 7) Offer a Free Trial in exchange for putting a card down.
Covered in the next chapter.



● “Seesaw” Downselling gradually shifts from paid-in-full to equal
payments.

● Payment plan upsell: they get the original discount price if they pay
the balance today.

● Align payment schedules with paycheck schedules to get fewer
declined payments.

At the end of all this, if someone still refuses to pay anything, then we
offer them a Free Trial in exchange for their card. But it’s not an ordinary
Free Trial. I do it in a special way. It took me years to perfect it. So that’s
where we go next. You’re gonna love it.



Trial With Penalty
If you do X, Y, Z, I’ll let you start for free.

 

Spring 2018.

Gym Launch was scaling fast. With 100 employees and counting, Leila
needed better HR solutions to manage it all. After months of sales calls with
prospective HR companies, she found one she liked. And to my surprise, it
wasn’t anything special—it looked like all the others.

“Yeah, the software is complicated,” she said. “But they got me.”

“Seriously? How did they manage that?”

“They had a trial offer with a weird spin. It was pretty smart.”



“What did they offer?”

“They said if I did their training I’d get free onboarding. But, if I skipped
the training I’d have to pay for it!”

“So what did you do?”

“I went through the training of course.”

“So they took your credit card, you did the training—then you didn’t have
to pay for the onboarding?”

“Yep!” she smirked. “And now I can actually use the complicated
software too.”

Lightbulb moment.

“Wait…you said no. Then, they downsold you a free trial on the condition
that they could penalize you if you didn’t use it?”

“Basically. I mean, it makes sense. It forced me to learn, and now I don't
want to learn anyone else’s complicated software…so we’re sticking with
them!”

“You’re right. That is pretty smart.”

***

The software company used Trial With Penalty as their Attraction Offer—
but I prefer to downsell trials. So, I only downsell the trial if they say no to
my first offer. And if you do it the way I’m about to show you, it only
changes what they pay today—not how much they pay in total.

Description

In a Trial With Penalty offer, customers can try your product or service for
free so long as they meet your terms. For comparison, Win Your Money
Back Offers (Attraction Offer #1) give customers the chance to get their



money back if they meet the terms. In Trial With Penalty Offers, customers
only pay if they don’t meet the terms.

Ideally, the terms should be things that make excellent customers. So,
they’ll mirror the actions and results used in your Win Your Money Back
Offer. But this time, we use avoiding fees (rather than winning money back)
to incentivize adherence.

So Trial With Penalty isn’t “here’s my thing—see if you like it.” It’s
“here’s my thing, you get it for free so long as you do this stuff…which
makes you a perfect fit for my next offer. And if you don’t, then you have to
pay for it.”

To do a Trial With Penalty downsell, you must consider what they have to
do to avoid the fee, and how you charge them. Normally, you get one chunk
of people to buy your main offer. So, offer that first. And the rest, you’ll get
on this downsell. Let’s say you normally close three of ten people on your
Attraction Offer. And now you downsell another four on a Trial With
Penalty. Then, after the trial finishes, upsell three of them. You go from three
sales to six sales—doubling your customers! If you only have one offer, you
lose everyone who says no. Downselling trials with a penalty gives people
another chance to say yes.

I’m still irritated at the thousands of customers I’ve lost on free trials over
the years before learning this. But now we can save them! The Trial With
Penalty makes it happen.

Important Notes

What They Get For Free And What They Have To Do To Avoid The
Fee. You’ll need to know what your terms of service will be. The valuable
parts will be either your bare bones offer (like the Decoy Offer) or your Win
Your Money Back offer. Either work. I’d recommend giving more rather



than giving less—if you can afford it. The criteria should activate and retain
customers. You can swipe these directly from Win Your Money Back—
Attraction Offer #1.

Breaking Up Fees vs. One Lump Fee. Say you have a $500 product with
ten things to do. I’d rather bill $50 for each mess up than one $500 fee on
their first mess up. On the other hand, if missing once really messes up their
success, you'll want the fee to reflect that. I’ve seen both work.

How To Downsell The Trial. Here’s a graphic to show how I downsell a
Trial with Penalty in five steps.

 

Offer The Trial Last. If someone makes it clear they don't want your first
offer, then downsell the Trial With Penalty. Here’s how it might
sound:“Hmmm…that sure is a pickle. I’ll tell ya what. How about we just get
ya started for free, would you be okay with that? We can just help you out,
and if you like it, you can stay. Let me get your ID and we can get the
process started—fair enough?”



 

Always Get A Credit Card. Record their info, hold onto the ID, and
motion for their credit card saying. “What card do you wanna use?” They
have to leave a card. If they balk, just say “That’s just how we’ve always
done it.” If they still refuse, wish them a lovely day and show them out.



Always Sell Staying And Paying. Ask directly: “If this program got you
the result, will you stay long-term?” You want them to agree to staying long-
term if you get them results. If they say no, there’s no point in giving them a
trial.

Then, we frame the conversation as if they’ll stay long-term, even if we
haven’t started billing them yet. So if they say ‘no,’ but want more
explanation, say something like this: “I don’t want you to try it. I want you to
get results. And out of integrity, I want to set realistic goals. You are not
going to hit your long-term goals during this trial. But, you will establish
habits that will help you get there. And we’re gonna help you do that for
free. But if you wanna get to your long-term results, you’re gonna have to
stay on after. I just wanna make sure that you’re not looking for a quick fix—
because I can’t ethically promise you that.”

Once they agree, move on.



 

Explain the fees after getting their card. I say something like:“We will
do our part so long as you do yours. That’s fair right? So now I just ask that
you bet on yourself—if you miss or skip any stuff, your results will suffer. We
charge to keep you on track. If you miss, no big deal. You’ll get dinged a
little fee but it’ll get you back on track. If you follow through, you get all this
for free. So this is the best way we can get you amazing results and keep it
free for you. Best of both worlds.”

Note: If you explain the fees before you get the card, you will get more
resistance. So explain after with a ‘this is just how we've always done it’
attitude. People still have to agree to the fees, but you’ll get a higher take
rate doing it this way. I always have customers initial separately next to the
fee clauses to force my sales guys to explain them.

 

Make Check-ins Required. First, we explain all criteria so they
understand the costs and benefits of adhering. Then, we draw attention to
check-ins (our upsell opportunities): “Yep, and you agree to attend each of
the three check-ins. The first we do X so that you can [benefit one], the
second we do Y so that you can [benefit two]…, the third we do Z so that you
can [benefit three]… Obviously we charge if you miss these because it’s the
only way we can get you results.”

How I Upsell From A Trial. When someone takes a trial, one of three
things happen: they like it, they hate it, or they don’t use it. Here’s how I



upsell them from each scenario.

1) If they like it: This is the easy one. You already have them set
up for automatic

billing. Great! Meet with them anyway. You can still offer a
longer term or higher value version of your service (or both).
Successful customers tend to get even more value out of your
better (and more profitable) stuff.

2) If they hate it: Turn that frown upside down. Ask them what
they would have liked to be

different. Tell them they’re totally right, and that you’re angry at
yourself for missing this. Do not blame them. Only one person
can be angry—and it needs to be you. Ask if they’ll give you a
chance to make it up because of how outraged you are at their
experience. And now, since you better understand their needs,
that they’re a better fit for your higher level thing. Then, offer it
to them. Yes—this is a sale. I can get about half of these people
to buy.

3) If they didn’t use it. Reach out to people multiple times before
you get to this point. Explain

that you need to meet with them. Offer to waive the fee if they do. Now, you
can try

to get them back on track or offer something better for them. I
don’t like billing non-starters. A small fee isn’t worth a 1-star
review. But hey, it’s your choice.

Tweak Your Trial To Get The Most Customers. If no one takes your
Trial, lower the requirements or penalties. If people take your Trial but don’t
follow through, emphasize explaining how fees help them and make sure
you include sales meetings as mandatory. If people don’t stay on the back
end, better emphasize the value of staying and paying, get better at
delivering, and make sure what you sell on the back end makes sense with
what you sell on the front end. If you start printing money, don’t stop.



Let People Make Up For Goofs. People often get discouraged after
getting billed. But, you can offer an opportunity to ‘make it up.’ This does a
great job of getting people back on track and converting. But, if they miss
that, you’re justified in billing them.

Just Call It A Trial. Even though the Trial With Penalty has some
‘special features,’ you should just call it a Free Trial. Otherwise, people may
get scared and confused. No one wants to be penalized. And if they ask you
why you do Free Trials this way just reply with “This is just how we’ve
always done it” or “People get the best results this way.”

Pay Less Now or Pay More Later vs. Trial With Penalty. I use Pay
Less Now or Pay More Later as a downsell for physical products or one-time
services. And I use Trial With Penalty as a downsell for recurring products or
services. Also, I have only made this work in businesses where the customer
has to do work to get results. If you find other types of businesses these work
for…let me know!

Discounts Get Cards on File. Some people get weird when you offer free
stuff and ask for a card. And if you have a super low price, it justifies asking
for the card. The small price means the card will probably work when the
automatic payments start. So instead of a free month, you might offer “first
month for $1” then $X per month when it recurs.

Summary Points

● In a Trial With Penalty offer, customers can try your product or
service for free so long as they

meet your terms.

● Trial With Penalty downsell offers get yeses from people who’ve said
no.

● To do them, you: get the card, get the commitment, explain what they
have to do to get

results and the meetings they must attend, and what happens if they don’t.



● Trials With Penalties get more paying customers than normal free trials
because they use

your product more and actually get value from it.

● Use the same ‘refund’ criteria from Win Your Money Back (Attraction
Offer #1) to create

your Trial With Penalty criteria. This way, at the end of the trial, they’ve
done the stuff that

makes great long-term customers (and advertise your business for free).

● You can break fees up by criteria or you can charge a lump fee. I like
breaking them up.

● You make money by getting people results and turning them into
customers, not nickeling

and diming people with fees.

● Use mid-trial check-ins to make more offers. If they love it, give them
more of what they

love. If they have problems with it, swap it for what makes sense for
them. If they aren’t

using it, offer them the ability to make it up to avoid the fees.






Feature Downsells
Why don’t we try this instead?

 

I can’t remember when in 2019.

“This new downsell tripled my close rate from 25% to 75% last quarter.
And even crazier, more people bought the main thing,” he said between
bites.

“You start offering a payment plan or a discount?”

“Neither. Payment plans take too long. And discounts devalue my
product.”

Huh…“We’re talking about a high-ticket product, right?”

“Yup.”

“Geez. What are you doing?

“I lower the price, but I justify it by cutting a feature. That way, I'm not
discounting.”

“So what feature did you cut?”

“My full money-back guarantee.”



“I never thought of guarantees as features, super intere–wait…you
downsell by removing your guarantee?”

“Yea. Works great. When we get a price objection we ask ‘If you don’t
want the option to get your money back, you can pay less. Or, you can keep
your money-back guarantee—which would you prefer?’ Once they
understand what they’d give up, they often say ‘Screw it, I’d rather keep the
guarantee and get my money back’.”

“Ahhhh…so they only see the value of the guarantee after you remove it.
And that also explains why so many more are buying the main thing.
Clever.” Then I followed up, “...how do the numbers break down?”

“Before, I only had one full-price option. So if 100 people got on a call,
25 bought. Now, 35 people buy the main thing and 40 take the downsell.”

“So it upped your full-price buyers, total close rate, and up front cash.
Nice!”

“Yeah, it changed my life,” he said.

***

The last two chapters covered Payment Plan Downsells and Trial With
Penalty. We downsold by keeping the overall price the same, only changing
when and how they paid.

In this chapter, we cover Feature Downsells. With these, we downsell by
lowering the price. But instead of a discount, which makes the same stuff
cheaper, we lower the price by changing what they get.

Description

Feature Downsells lower prices by changing what customers get. I do
them by offering lesser quantity, lower quality, lower price alternatives, or
cutting optional components.

All features have a price and a value. If you remove something the price
goes down, sure. But, the value goes down too. What features you remove



and how much you lower the price affects how good of a deal the person
gets. This change in your offer’s price-to-value affects how people buy.
People wanna get the best deal for them.

For instance, if you remove stuff they hate, and lower the price a lot, they
get a better deal. If you remove stuff they love, and lower the price a little,
they get a worse deal. Both get people to buy. In the story, customers loved
the guarantee. The guarantee had far more value than its price. So even if
they said no at first, removing the guarantee instantly showed its value. The
customers saw the higher-price offer as a better deal. So, after seeing the
downsell option, they bought the first offer.

People will see the value in the thing you removed after they see the
difference in price. As in, people weigh how much money they save against
how much value they lose. So, clever Feature Downselling gets customers to
“re-upsell” themselves on the more expensive offers. This means you want
to remove features from highest to lowest value. Since people want more
value for their money, this incentivizes customers to make the highest value
purchase for them.

Feature Downsells have a simple formula: take something away, lower the
price, and in so many words ask “how about now?”

Feature Downsell Examples

Feature Downselling Product and Service Quantity. For services, this
might mean a lower amount, fewer sessions, less time, or shorter duration.
For products, it means fewer of them.

Product Quantity Downsell: Instead of a three-month supply, how about
we start with just one?

Service Quantity Downsell: Instead of four sessions per month, why don't
we start you at two?

Feature Downselling Product Quality. Think older versions, less
reliable materials, materials of lower social status, etc.



Product Quality Downsell: Instead of the leather seats we can do vinyl,
how does that sound?

Feature Downselling Service Quality. This means a lot of things. I will
give you a few ways I change the quality of services. Hint: This also works
to increase the service quality.

Service Quality Downsell: Instead of 5-minute response times, why don't
we just start you at overnight

response times? You’ll save some money and you’ll still get your answers
—just with a small delay.

More Service Quality Features:

● Time Availability: Come specific times vs. whenever you want

○ Days of week: Mon/Wed/Fri vs. All Days ○ Times of day: 9
to 5 vs. 24hrs ○ Amount of time: 15 min Support Calls vs. 60
min Support Calls

● Location Availability: This one location vs. all locations we own
● Cancellations: Reschedule fees vs. free ● Speed Of Response:
Reply in minutes vs. hours vs. days etc. ● Speed Of Delivery: Wait
in line vs. priority, same day/next day vs. next week etc. ● Service
Ratio: One-on-one vs. one-to-many vs. many-to-one ●
Communication Method: Text Support vs. Chat Support vs. Video
Call Support etc. ● Provider Qualifications: Owner vs. long-time
employee vs. new employee, etc. ● Live vs. Recorded: Watch it
happening now vs. watch it after it happens later ● In-Person vs.
Remote: Watch where it happens vs. watch it somewhere else ●
DIY, DWY, DFY. Do It Yourself vs. Done With You vs. Done For
You ● Expirations: Works forever vs. works for X time vs. works
at specific times ● Personalization: Generic vs. made just for you
● Insurance/Guarantee:

○ Lengths of time: For One Year vs. For Life ○ Coverage:
Specific bad thing happens vs. Any bad thing happens ○
Terms: Unconditional vs. Only if you do XYZ



Downselling by Removing Entire Features. Rather than lowering
quantity or quality, you remove the feature itself. In the story, he removed a
guarantee.

Removing Entire Feature Downsell: Instead of priority chat support,
email support, and calls, why

don’t we just keep chat and email support but drop the calls to save you
some money? You’ll still get your

answers, it’ll just save us time and we can pass those savings to you.

Feature Downselling Done-For-You to Do-It-Yourself. If someone says
no to all your service downsells, you can downsell another product that
solves the same problem.

Done-For-You to Do-It-Yourself Product Downsell:

● Chiropractor: Instead of chiropractic adjustments, let’s start you
with some tools you can use to do

it yourself at home? Then, you’d sell at home massage tools,
foam rollers, mats, etc.

● Painter: If you can’t afford me painting your house, why don't I
just give you the paint and let you

lease one of our spray machines for a daily rate?

● Alex Hormozi: Instead of me and my team buying your company
and actively growing your

business, why don’t you just attend a workshop? (*Cough* Go
to acquisition.com)

Important Notes

Remember, Never Negotiate The Price. People who demand to pay less
for the same thing are business terrorists. I don’t negotiate with terrorists. If



they want to pay less now—offer a payment plan. If they want to pay less
overall—offer a feature downsell. But don’t let anyone pay less just because.

Maintain The Position Of A Helpful Guide. Remember, Feature
Downselling means trying to find the best deal for them. This keeps the
conversation collaborative rather than competitive. If you act pushy, your
offers will exhaust customers faster. If you stay a helpful guide, you can
downsell as many offers as necessary without exhausting the customer.

Tweak Your Feature Downsell Process. We have the job of making the
product have the highest value-to-cost in the eyes of the customer. But, in the
beginning, you won’t know much about your customers’ preferences. So, as
you solve the same problems for the same type of customer, you’ll learn
what they find the most valuable. Once you do, you can standardize your
Feature Downsell process. Feature Downsells close more people when you
know what feature combinations to present ahead of time.

How I Standardize My Downsell Process. First, I cut something
valuable and lower the price a little. I do this to get them to reconsider the
original offer/price. If that fails, I continue removing features and lowering
prices until they buy. I’d rather people get something rather than nothing.

Name Your Feature Combinations. Name the most expensive
combination after a status your customer would find aspirational, such as
“The Whale Package,” “The Total Transformation,”

“High Roller” etc. Look at airlines. Make your version of First
Class→Business Class→Economy.

I Name My Cheapest Combination “The Minimum.” I like it because
it implies they have to get at least that thing. If someone rejects all other
packages, I just say “so nothing more than the minimum package then?” to
get them to say no to say yes (like the Classic Upsell).

Temperature Check After Two Downsells (Like Payment Plans). If
you make two changes in a row and they still refuse, make sure they really
want the thing. I’d say something like “Got it. Real quick. I want to make
sure. On a scale from 1–10 how bad do you want this?”



If They Say 8 Or Above, Start Payment Plan Downselling. “Awesome.
Don’t worry. We’re gonna figure out a way to make this happen for you.” If
they say 7 or below, ask “What would a 10 look like?” and then, recombine
the features to try and accommodate their ‘10.’ Note: this means you can
alternate between payment plan and feature downsells. When you use both,
you become very difficult to refuse.

After Each Downsell, Ask “Deal?” Or “Fair Enough?” This works
astonishingly well. Fewer people will see you change the offer for them and
then say “No that’s not fair.” Listen to how I present Feature Downsells on
Episode 202 of my podcast The Game, “How to close everyone: downselling
like a pro.”

Free Orientations Boost Do-It-Yourself Feature Downsells. Once
someone has refused all my Done For You offers, I ask “Even though we’re
not gonna work together on X, I still want to help. How about you just come
to a free orientation on X tomorrow?” At the end of the orientation, I offer a
DIY product that solves the same problem as the DFY service. For example I
offered a free orientation to people who refused my fitness offer. Of the
people who showed up to the orientation (about half), almost all of them
bought supplements. It got me money from people who would've otherwise
said no. Free money for little extra work.

Feature Downsell Your Guarantees. If you already have a guarantee,
make removing it part of your Feature Downsell process. People value
security, so removing it gets many people to realize its value. This often flips
an initial ‘no’ back to a ‘yes.’

Feature Downsell Current Customers. Customers who use all the
features they pay for keep paying longer than people who don’t. So once you
see a customer isn’t using a feature, offer a lower price—only paying for the
features they use. They’ll either tell you they want to keep it and might start
using it again—or—they’ll be happy you gave them a better deal. It takes
work, but it beats them canceling. Fun fact: Customers who we’ve downsold
into a lower package just for them have the second highest value of all my
customers. When people have a product they like at a price they find fair,
they keep paying.



Barter With Reviews, Testimonials, And Referrals. Bartering is the
oldest form of exchange. My sharp rock for your rabbit skin. And I love
bartering. If I get a price objection, sometimes I offer discounts in exchange
for advertising. Ex:“I’ll knock $100 off if you: 1) Leave me a review on all
review sites 2) Leave me a video testimonial 3) Make a public social post at
the beginning, middle, and end of our program showing your progress 4)
Introduce me to two friends who you would want to do this with. Deal?” To
me, the advertising is worth more than the $100 discount. To them, the $100
is worth less than the advertising. Win-win.

Summary Points

● Feature Downsells lower prices by removing stuff.

● You take something away, lower the price, and ask “how about now?”

● Typical Feature Downsells offer Lesser Quantity, Lower Quality,
Lower Price Alternatives, or

remove features altogether.

● People tend to see the value in what you removed after they see the
price difference. This may get

more people to take the more expensive offer.

● If you remove stuff they hate, and lower the price a lot, more people
take the downsell.

● If you remove stuff they love, and lower the price a little, more
people take the original offer.

● The first downsell gets them to reconsider my first offer. The rest of
my downsells get them to

consider the best deal for them.

● If a prospect rejects multiple downsells, see if they still want your
thing before continuing.



● If a prospect likes a combination of features, but still doesn’t like the
price, start payment

plan downselling. Very effective.

● Feature downsell current customers before they cancel.

● You can discount customers in exchange for them advertising your
business.



Downsell Offers Conclusion
Everybody buys something.

 

Downsells give you another shot at getting a customer by turning nos into
yeses. For that reason, it’s less about having a hundred different products
with the same offer, and more about having a hundred different offers for the
same product. But, no matter what, the offer is never the same stuff for
cheaper. We just keep tweaking the offer until we make it the best deal for
them. The extra cash explodes our 30-day profits and blows us past our
goals.

So we’ve used attraction offers to get customers to buy once. We’ve used
upsells to get them to buy the next thing. And now I’ve shown you my three
most powerful downsell processes in case they say no: Payment Plan
Downsells, Trial With Penalty, and Feature Downsells.

Next, we’ve got the final stage of a $100M Money Model—Continuity
Offers: how to keep them buying for good.

Section V: Continuity Offers

You can shear a sheep for a lifetime, but you can only skin it once. - John, an
early mentor



 

I’ve been a continuity guy my entire life: personal fitness, then gyms, then
gym licensing, then supplements, then software, and now with
Acquisition.com…lots of stuff. Needless to say, I’m a fan. Main reason:
when you do continuity right, you get more customers and make more
money from them. Continuity Offers provide ongoing value that customers
make ongoing payments for—until they cancel. They boost the profit from
every customer and give you one last thing to sell. Continuity Offers are
awesome because you sell once, but get paid again and again.

Let me explain.

Let’s say you offer a $1,000 thing to 100 people and 10 buy—you make
$10,000 (10 x $1,000).



Now, let’s say you talk to the same 100 people but you make your $1,000
thing…$50 per month instead. At fifty bucks, we can get 40 out of 100 to
buy. And, if you keep those people for twenty months. You still make $1,000
from each customer. You go from making $10,000 now and $0 over time to
$2,000 now and $40,000 over time.

As an added bonus, in the first example, if you only sold 10 customers,
you’d only have 10 customers to upsell later. If you used a Continuity Offer
and sold 40 customers, you’d have four times the customers to upsell later. A
massive difference.

This illustrates the pros and cons of continuity. You can attract more
customers compared to something more expensive, but you make way less
money now. That makes it tough to use as an Attraction Offer on its own.
Even if you have more money-making potential tomorrow, Continuity
Attraction Offers leave you strapped for cash today.

By making continuity offers last, we get the best of all worlds. We get
cash today from Attraction Offers, Upsell Offers, and Downsell Offers. We
get a little cash today and tons of cash tomorrow from Continuity Offers.

To be clear—you can make Continuity Offers wherever and however you
want. They can attract new customers, upsell and downsell current
customers, or re-engage old customers.

Also, only some stuff makes sense for a Continuity Offer. It’s silly for
someone to pay for a one-day workshop…forever. It makes sense for them
to pay until they cover the cost—and that makes it a payment plan. At the
same time, you probably make a mistake to offer a single price (even a big
price) to provide a service forever. If your customers get ongoing value, it
probably makes sense for them to make ongoing payments.

The Three Continuity Offers

All offers depend on getting customers to buy. But, Continuity Offers
depend on getting customers to keep buying. I get them to do both by
combining bonuses, discounts, and fees.

● Continuity: Bonus Offers



● Continuity: Discount Offers

● Waived Fee Offer

Now that we got that covered. You can’t get customers to stick to your
continuity offer unless they’ve started…so let’s start there.



Continuity Bonus Offers
If you like this, you’re gonna love what I have next…

 

Fall 2019. When I learned that bonuses got more people to join continuity
programs…

I taught gym owners how to sell six-week challenges and they were
making money hand over fist. But some of them weren’t that good at
converting people into continuity after the challenge. Then, out of the blue…
I saw a gym that used to struggle posting numbers way higher than some of
our best performers.

Naturally, I investigated…

“Dude—your numbers are insane. How do you convert so many
members?” I asked.



“I’m not really doing the six-week challenge,” he said.

“Wait. What do you mean? You’re marketing the six-week challenge
though, right?”

“Yep. But I offer them something else when they come in.”

“Okay…help me understand.”

“So we go through the normal pitch. We explain the price. Yada yada. As
soon as they say they're interested, we ask if they want to get it for free.
They of course say yes. Then, I tell them that if they become a member,
we’ll make it free, which they love. And on top of that, if they become
members, they also get member-exclusive bonuses. Members get better class
times, the tanning booth, VIP events, all sorts of cool stuff. It converts like
crazy. Last, we upsell a discounted prepaid membership.”

“How does that go?” I asked.

“Well, for anyone who joins, we immediately ask ‘wanna save even more
money?’ They lean in. Then we offer a prepaid discount and bonuses for six
months of membership.”

“This is awesome. Does anyone even take the original challenge offer
anymore?”

“Some do, sure. Can't be mad at more up front cash.”

“I dig it. Break down some of your numbers, would you?”

“Before, we’d get thirty-four out of a hundred to sign up for the challenge.
Then, a few weeks later we’d convert half (seventeen) to stay. Now, we only
get like fifteen to sign up for the challenge but we get forty to go straight into
continuity. And of those forty, about eight of them take the six month
prepayment upsell.”

“So let me get this straight…you tripled membership sales…you still get
up front cash from challenges…and you stack even more up front cash from
prepaid memberships??”



He could barely contain his grin. And for good reason. His tiny tweak was
genius.

Description

With Continuity Bonuses you give the customer an awesome thing if they
sign up today. Typically, the bonus itself has more value than the first
continuity payment. That’s all there is to it.

Bonus—adding value. For products, you can give away many small things
or one big product that complements the subscription. For services, you give
away a defined program, onboarding, setup, or feature that adds value.

Discount—lowering costs. Remember, anything you offer for free you can
also offer as a discount. Free stuff and discounts both affect how we make
decisions. So, we want to do both to get the benefits of both.

When making Continuity Offers, I get more people to start if I add more
good stuff (bonuses) and take away bad stuff (discounts). And of course, it
all works better with a dash of urgency—if they join now. Also, you can
offer the bonus as a standalone purchase, or you can only make it available if
they buy your continuity. Either works.

On their own, Continuity Offers get less cash now, and that makes it tough
for getting customers profitably. But the way I use them, we can still hit our
30-day profit goals. Here’s how: First, I do all my big-cash Attraction,
Upsell, and Downsell offers. Then, Continuity Offers get a little bit of cash
from the first month's payments. Then, I offer people who bought one month
a discount on prepaying more months. This further boosts 30-day profits,
giving me more cash to advertise, and stacks recurring revenue. Not too
shabby.



 

Examples Of Getting People To Start On Continuity

Physical Product: Pet Food Continuity Offer

One-Time Bonus: Get every dog toy we’ve ever made for free, an $800
value, when you sign up for monthly dog food shipments for $59 per month.

Monthly Bonuses: You’ll get a new dog toy every month as a member.

Service: Short-Term Accelerator Offer

One-Time Bonus: Short Term Accelerator costs $1,000 on its own. Get it free
when you become a member for $100 per month.

Bonus Package: The VIP community members enjoy first in line access to
our events, longer support hours, better support reps, etc.

Digital Product Offer

One-Time Bonus: Get all my past 40 newsletters valued at $15,880 by
becoming a member today for only $399/mo after a 30-day free trial.

Lifetime Discount + Lifetime Bonuses: If you pay today, you can lock in a
lifetime discount to $299 per month. Get early digital access and a physical
copy every month.



Note: Use the elements from the Feature Downsell chapter to create better
bonuses. Important Notes

Focus On The Bonus, Not The Membership. “Join my membership
program” isn’t nearly as compelling as “get this free valuable thing.” So
advertise that. Then, explain the rest after they show interest.

Bonuses Work Kinda Like Upsells.

More of the same: You get two years of past newsletters free by becoming a
member. Complementary: You get nutrition services for free when you sign
up for our fitness membership. Upgrade: You get a free gold membership
when you buy a bronze membership (limited availability).

Keep Your Bonuses Related To Your Core Offer. If the bonus is too
different you will attract the wrong customers. For instance, don’t advertise
a free t-shirt to upsell tech services. But, advertising a free t-shirt to upsell t-
shirt printing makes sense.

Make Bonuses Things You Already Have And Do. For instance, the two
past years of newsletters cost no extra time but are super high value. And
onboarding is something you have to do with the client anyways, so you
might as well slap a price on it and give to ‘em as a bonus. If you value it,
they will too.

Physical Bonuses on Digital Products and Digital Bonuses with
Physical Products. If I have a digital membership, I might offer a hat, shirt,
or tool, etc. related to the offer. If I have a physical product or service, like a
boxing gym membership, offering live stream classes can get more people to
sign up. This strategy often lowers the cost of getting a customer more than
the cost of the bonus. And that’s the point. Also, if some people take the
bonus and run, the lower advertising costs can still make up for it. If
customers are too expensive, give it a try.

Use Realistic Bonus Pricing. The bigger the value-anchor on your bonus,
the more compelling the offer. But, you also have to make that anchor
believable. Some business owners make up ridiculous values. Don’t do this.
It won’t anchor the customer and you’ll lose trust with them. This is a great



opportunity to give away products you’ve sold before. You can anchor their
actual prices as real discounts and bonuses.

You Can Bonus Your Customers By Giving Them Titles. Consider
giving customers titles after they stay three, six, or twelve months and
beyond. Titles like silver, gold, diamond, double diamond, etc. A good friend
of mine does this, and after a while, she found her customers cared more
about the title than any other bonus. She told me they even introduced
themselves to her by their title! So, if you can't think of something to give
them, at the very least, you can call them something special.

You Can Make Free Bonuses Discounts and Make Discounts Free
Bonuses. Free Bonus: Become a member for $200 then you get this $1,000
program as a free bonus! Steep Discount: Get the $1,000 program for $1 if
you become a member for $200.

When Making Your Continuity Offer, Anchor The Bonuses. First, sell
them the benefits of the amazing bonus. Not your Continuity Offer—the
bonus. Then, use your high-value bonus as an anchor. It may shock them—
and that’s okay. Because then you ask, “Do you want to know how you can
get this for free?” If they do, which they will, explain how: “Become a VIP
member today and you’ll get it all as a free gift for joining. Or, you can just
buy it for $XXX—which would you prefer?”

More Bonuses Get More People To Join. After you ask them if they
want to know how to get it for free, you tell them they can get it when they
join. Then you say “on top of that…when you become a member you’ll
get…amazing thing 1, amazing thing 2, amazing thing 3.” Mention the
individual dollar values of each to anchor the value. Stacking bonuses this
way gets even more people to join your continuity.

Making Bonuses Available Only To Those Who Join. If you want to
force everyone into continuity, then offer continuity as the only option. In
other words, make the bonuses only available if they join the membership.

Pricing For Continuity vs. Up Front Cash. For whatever reason, some
people pick one-time payments over continuity…even with higher one-time
payments. So offer a higher one-time payment option. This way some



customers will make you more money today while others stack recurring
revenue for tomorrow. We change the price depending on our goals. I’ve
tested this a ton and, at least for me, the data in this range look clear. Check
it out:



To get 50% to choose continuity make the standalone offer 1.33x more.

Ex: $399 standalone ($266/mo) or $199/mo membership

To get 60% to choose continuity make the standalone offer 1.66x more.

Ex: $499 standalone ($333/mo) or $199/mo membership

To get 70% to choose continuity make the standalone offer 2x more.

Ex: $599 standalone ($399/mo) or $199/mo membership

To get 80% to choose continuity make the standalone offer 2.33x more.

Ex: $699 standalone ($466/mo) or $199/mo membership

To get 90% to choose continuity make the standalone offer 2.66x more.



Ex: $799 standalone ($532/mo) or $199/mo membership

The exact numbers matter less than the principle. The smaller the
standalone price compared to the continuity price, the more people buy the
standalone. The larger the standalone price compared to the continuity
price, the more people choose continuity.

If You Want More Up Front Cash. Make bonuses and
continuity+bonuses separate offers. Make the bonus-only offer a single
payment that’s 1.33x to 2.66x more expensive than the first month of the
continuity+bonus offer. The bigger the price difference, the fewer standalone
purchases you’ll have. But, the more money you make up front from each.
Based on the data I just shared, people pay 33% more to avoid continuity. In
other words, even if you charge 33% more for a one-time purchase, half will
buy it!

If You Want Even More Cash—Offer Bulk Prepaid Discounts. Bulk
continuity upsells boost 30-day profits by a lot. Let’s say you offer “buy five
months get one free.” Only one out of every eight people has to take the
upsell to raise 30-day profits by 50%! That can make or break your Money
Model. Note: The laws of discounting apply—the larger the discount, the
more people will take it.

If You Want Commitments—Prepare To Make A Trade. If you want
commitments, trade them for bonuses. For example, only allow customers to
get the bonus if they commit to 3-6-12+ months. When you only give it to
customers who commit, you’ll lose people who would’ve signed up month-
to-month just to get the bonus. This nets fewer sales, but more committed
customers. This is the trade you make.

Summary Points

When it comes down to it, offering real discounts and then following up
with valuable free bonuses makes people excited about your offer. Then, if
they agree to your continuity offer, you can further upsell blocks of time to
boost your 30-day profits even more.



● With Continuity Bonuses you give the customer an awesome thing if they
sign up today.

Typically, the bonus itself has more value than the first continuity
payment.

● If you use Continuity as an attraction offer, advertise what you give
away, not what you sell.

● Make your bonus related to your core offer so you engage the right
leads.

● If possible, make your bonuses stuff you already have and do. This
way, you don’t need to

change your business or create new products.

● More people start continuity if you add more bonuses and discounts.

● To add bonuses—add more good stuff only if they sign up.

● To discount—take away the cost of actual products, services, and
features you sell.

● Sell the value of the bonus before telling them how they can get it for
free.

● Offer bonuses as a standalone option for more up front cash.

● If you want half the people to take the standalone offer, price it 33%
above your continuity.

● Boost up front cash even more by offering continuity at a discount if
they buy in bulk.

Spring 2018.

Leila and I had just moved into one of the nicer Austin suburbs. On our
afternoon walk, a neighbor smiled and waved us over. It looked like she
wanted to make “welcome to the neighborhood” small talk. I hate small talk.
But as I got closer, I got more interested. The yard was perfect. A Ferrari
stuck out of their garage for “spring cleaning.” The patio table was littered
with cigarettes and beer cans. Huh?

“Hi there, welcome to the neighborhood…let me get the husband.” I
smiled through gritted teeth. Here we go. Out came the character—in a
backwards hat, flip flops, with a strong midwest accent, speaking a mile in a
minute, and the widest grin you’ve ever seen.

“Hey brotherman! Nice to meetcha. I can tell yer no doctor or lawyer
livin’ here so young.

So what kinda hustle you got?” He also got straight to the point. Relief. I
told him a bit about my gyms, launching gyms, and the rise of Gym Launch.
He nodded with approval. He said he liked having another business owner
on the street.

“What about you?” I asked.



He smirked.“Trash.”

“What?”

“Trash.”

He saw my confused look and continued.

“Alright, so ya see, I knew from my time workin’ trash there wasn't much
competition. Big commercial places and all went to the same place for their
trash needs.”

“So what did you do?”

“Well, I had a truck, took my credit card, and I gambled.” He continued.
“I went to all the big apartments and said I’d do their trash for a whole year
free if they contracted me to do the next five years paid. It worked good
enough. They all made me their trash man before I knew it.”

“Dang,” I said. “You fronted an entire year?”

“Uh-huh. And I’ll tell you what, it was the toughest thing I ever did. No
one would invest in my business, not even my family. They all called me
crazy. But after that one year mark passed, the cash came floodin’. I ate real
fat then. And after a few years usin’ that plan, I sold the whole shebang for a
pretty penny.”

“Nice, man. I never would've thought there was so much money in trash.”

“There’s cash in trash baby, what can I say. Oh yeah…you want a beer, or
what?” Needless to say, we’ve stayed friends to this day.

***

Listening to his success showed me the sheer power of a simple offer
done right. That said, let’s go over some important stuff so you can make it
work like he did.



Also, if you think this looks like “Buy X Get Y Free” done continuity-
style, then you’d be right. However, there are enough differences specific to
continuity that it justified its own chapter.

Description

To make a one-time continuity discount, you give products or services
away for free if the customer commits to buying more products and services
over time. This can attract loads of potential customers and makes an easy
sale anyone can close.

If you look around, you’ll see this offer in many different industries. It
works. Think internet, pool cleaning, gym memberships, landscaping, and
anything rentable. I mention common ones, but you can make this work in
any business so long as you know two things. First, how you’ll apply the
discount—I do it four ways. And second, your cancellation policy—because
people don’t always keep their commitments.

Examples

I discount in four ways: Up front, at the end, an even spread, or after the
first month or two.



Up Front. You apply the discount up front and push out the term. As in, the
“official” time starts after their free time ends. This works best in industries
that have a successful history of enforcing contracts (cell phones, storage,
real estate, equipment, or anything with collateral). Two notes: First, if you
have historically high churn, then skip this one and consider the others.
Second, this does not get customers profitably. It gets customers, but delays
cash. So if you want more profitable options, continue on.

 

 

At The End. You can apply the entire discount at the end and push out the
term. So long as they make every payment on time…they get a bonus time
equal to the value of the discount. They earn their free time.



Spread Over Time. Apply the discount across the term. Say you give three
months free for a one-year commitment. At $200 per month you’ve
discounted $600. By spreading that $600 over 12 months, they get a $600/12
months = $50 discount each month. You can also tell them that if they make
all their payments on time, they can keep the discount for life after the term
is over.



 

After the first 1–2 payments. They pay a few times and then they get their
one-time discount. This way you collect a bit of cash to cover advertising
and some delivery costs. I prefer to do it by presenting the offer as “first and
last month,” “last month up front,” or adding some sort of activation fee
before getting the bonus value. It also ensures the customer uses a valid form
of payment…a small but important detail when you run a business.

Important Notes

**Highest Value Per Word Note In This Book** Skip this if you hate
money. Bill weekly (weekly, every 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks etc). Here’s
why. There are 12 months in a year, but the year has 13 four-week cycles.
That’s an 8.3% difference. If I offer my thing at “$100 every four weeks”
(versus $100 a month) the same number of people buy. But, I make 8.3%
more annually. To put this into perspective, if your business has 20%
margins, this skyrockets annual profit by 41%. And the best part is, you
don’t do any more work. Just change a few words. What else can you do



legally that makes so much money for so little work? This has literally made
me millions in pure profit. So yeah, do it.

Don’t Eat Into The Term With Discounts, Extend Them! Let’s say you
offer three months free when you sign up for a year. That could mean they
pay for nine months then get three free (12 total months). Or, that could
mean they pay 12 months and get three free (15 total months). I prefer to
start with extending the term. Then, I can Feature Downsell a shorter one.

Get 3% More Revenue For Five Extra Words. “Yea, it's $X plus a 3%
processing fee.” In my life, I've never had anyone not buy because of a
processing fee. But 3% added to your topline for no extra work goes straight
to your bottom line. If you run a 10% profit business, and add 3%, you just
added 30% to your profit. Worth it. And this works especially well when
paired with…

Get Two Forms Of Payment. Recurring businesses lose mountains of
cash because of payment processing problems. First, customers don’t cancel
but their payment information changes or expires. Second, customers max
out cards or have insufficient funds. We fix both issues with the same
solution. I ask them if they want a 3% discount (a pretty standard processing
fee). “Do you want to save the processing fee? …awesome. Give us a second
form of payment in case anything happens to the first one.” If they ask why,
which they rarely do, just say “We only have the processing fee because it
costs us man hours to get new payment information every month from our
customers. So if you save us time, we pass the savings onto you.”

Get ACH If You Can. If you get a second form of payment, try to get
ACH. This is a form of payment that links directly to their bank account. It’s
the cheapest way to transact besides cash. If you don’t know what ACH is,
look it up.

Gift Cards. Give the discounted time in the form of a physical gift card.
You can mail it to them if they are out of the area. The customer can apply
the discount whenever they want after the first three payments or so. Then
you can say they can also gift it to a friend if they want. And now you’ve got
a lead magnet! Beyond that, many people simply forget to use it. In that
instance, you just got a full-priced sign-up. Nice!



Try Lifetime Discount At Your Most Common Churn Point. You
advertise the lifetime discount. But, you make customers earn it. They get a
lower rate if they stay past X period. Make X the month your average
customer drops off.

Let’s say you know every customer stays four months on average. You’d
tell everyone up front they get a lifetime discount after month four. As the
time approaches, tell them their new lower rate is right around the corner.

Real world example: I saw a rice company selling (a lot) of rice. They
offered three pricing options: 1) a one-time price 2) a 5% off subscription 3)
15% off if you stayed on the subscription for five straight months. You
earned the lifetime lower rate. I’m sure they figured out that it was just
beyond where most people canceled.

CANCELLATIONS

You Need To Have A Cancellation Policy Figured Out Ahead Of Time.
There are many common ones. 30 or 60 days notice. Cancellation fees.
Cancel anytime. Etc. Since everyone comes into my Continuity Offers on a
discount of some kind, this is my favorite:

Just make the cancellation fee equal to the discount they agreed to get. So
if they got $600 in discounts by committing, they can pay $600 whenever
they want to cancel. This is simple to explain.

Make Sure Customers Know How To Cancel. If customers have
nowhere to complain inside your business, they will definitely complain
outside of your business. If you have no obvious way for them to cancel,
more people will vanish and complain. By having a clear way for them to
contact you, then you can have a real chance to save it. Small businesses
don’t get rich by making stuff hard for their customers. If you make it easy,
you’ll suffer fewer 1-star reviews and have a chance to save them when they
do—because you’ll know about it.

If A Customer Wants To Cancel, Ask To Do An Exit Interview. Some
people like to vent. Let them. Get more angry about the problem than them.
They may try to calm you down. Sometimes, they will save themselves! If



they complain about something you can solve then, by golly, solve it. And if
they wanted a better product, do a rollover upsell into a higher level of
service if you have one to offer. I’ve had many people buy a lower cost offer
and then complain because they wanted the higher cost features. So I offer
higher cost features, and they buy. Yes. It happens. And yes, it works.

Use Cancellation Fees To The Customer’s Advantage. I might say “I’ll
waive your cancellation fee if you come in and tell me what I could do
better.” This gives customers a real reason to give feedback. Then, I can use
their feedback to fix the problem—or—offer something better suited for
them. At the very least, they'll have nicer things to say about the business if I
actually try to solve the problem. I routinely save a third of customers that
agree to exit interviews.

Summary Points

● Continuity Discount Offers give continuity time for free if the
customer signs up today.

● Frontloaded discounts convert more customers, but may have higher
churn.

● Backloading discounts converts fewer customers, but they lower
churn.

● Spreading the discount keeps cash flowing while providing the full
discount.

● Use gift cards to give the discount to new customers and allow them
to gift it to a friend or

use it on themselves at a later date. You get a full priced sign-up and a
referral!

● Allow customers to earn a lifetime discount at your month of greatest
churn to encourage

customers to stick through it for a lifetime lower rate.



● Light cancellation terms get more people to sign up but more people leave.
Harsher terms

get fewer sign-ups but fewer leave. I prefer customers cancel by paying
the discount they got

with their commitment. This puts them back at the month-to-month rate.

● Make sure customers know how to cancel.

● If a customer wants to cancel, ask for an exit interview. Incentivize
them by saying you’ll

waive the cancellation fee if they do. You’ll often be able to save or upsell
them from the

conversation. At the very least, you understand what went wrong so you
can get better.



Waived Fee Offer
You can sign up month-to-month with a setup fee, or I’ll waive it if you

commit to a year.

 

January 2021.

For years, I heard stories about this legend of high-ticket sales. Today, I
finally got to meet him. But then, it got weird. You’d think a man with a
reputation like his would also love working, but not him. In fact, his views
about work nearly opposed mine—he aimed to work as little as possible.
And those “lifestyle” guys tend to put me off. But he had his legendary
reputation for a reason. So, it made me all the more interested…

“I’d rather make a few million bucks a year with zero employees and cool
customers than build some gigantic business that panders to anyone willing
to give me a buck,” he said. “I don’t need to feed my ego, I just collect
monthly payments and chill.”

Yeah right. “Monthly payments? That sounds less chill than up front.
Don’t you have to deal with churn, back outs, and all the other hassles of
continuity?” I said.



“Nope. Not really. The way I sell is so simple you’ll kick yourself once
you hear it,” he said.

“I’m all ears.”

“I tell customers they have two options: ‘You can go month-to-month with
a big setup fee. It covers the cost of getting you started, but you can leave
whenever. Or, if you commit to a year, I’ll waive the fee.’ And I make the fee
huge, so buyers commit to avoid it. I also have them initial that they
understand they can quit early if they pay the fee I waived.”

“Why such a big fee?” I asked.

“It costs a lot to quit in the beginning, so that keeps them engaged and—”

I chimed in “and once they pass that point, it costs about the same to
cancel as it does to stick it out. So, they just stick it out.”

“Bingo.”

Description

Waived Fee Offers work like this. First, you ask the customer to pay a
startup fee as part of joining a month-to-month program. Typically, I do 3–
5x my monthly rate. Then, you offer to discount the entire fee if they commit
longer term. But, if they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee.

Customers can choose to pay a significant fee and keep the option to quit
at any time, or they can commit to 12 months and get the fee waived. Many
will commit to avoid the big fee.

We take a greater risk if they pay month-to-month. But they take a greater
risk if they

commit. If a customer chooses month-to-month, we lower our risk with the
startup fee. But, we lower their risk year-to-year by waiving those fees. And
if they commit and want to quit early, then OK. They pay as if they had
chosen “month-to-month” from the beginning. Simple.



Bottom Line: Customers will stay longer if leaving costs more than
staying.

Example

Since the offer focuses more on pricing, it looks the same in all continuity
businesses. The following example pulls from the story to give you a closer
look at the mechanics.

Waived Fees With Commitment.

1) Commitment length - 12 months

2) Monthly rate - $1,000 per month

3) Fee - $5,000 if they pay month-to-month.

Option A: Pay a one-time fee of $5,000 plus $1,000 for the first month.
Then pay $1,000 per

month thereafter. Cancel whenever you want.

Option B: Waive the $5,000 if you commit to 12 months. Pay $1,000 per
month. Only pay

the $5,000 fee if you break your commitment early.

Important Notes

Fees Get Them To Start. People get value out of committing immediately
because they avoid a fee. People want to avoid fees. So, more people sign up
to continuity. Mission accomplished.

Fees Get Them To Stick. People will stick for the same reason they
started. By sticking, they avoid the fee. People quit for millions of reasons.
But, by incurring an additional and larger fee in order to cancel, their
original reason for quitting immediately shrinks compared to the value of
avoiding the fee. In English, if the cost to quit exceeds the cost to stay, they
will probably stay.



Presenting The Fee. Justify the fee by explaining the costs of taking on
new customers for long-term programs. Basically, if they want short-term
flexibility, they pay their own setup costs. But, if they commit to staying
long-term, we pay their setup costs for them. If someone asks for additional
reasoning, just say: “It costs us money to get you started. If you only wanna
test us out, you cover those costs. If you commit longer, I’ll cover them.”

If More Than 5% Of People Want To Cancel Early, Look Into It.
Pricing incentivizes sticking but it can’t (and shouldn’t) overcome a terrible
product. You want to nudge them, not handcuff people into paying for
something they hate. Then, they’ll just hate you.

If You Want More Up Front Cash, Have A Smaller Fee. A smaller fee
encourages people to go month-to-month. A larger fee encourages people to
make the commitment. But if you need more cash up front, you can make
the fee 1.5–3x the monthly rate. When you do this, more people will take it,
and you’ll get more cash up front.

Drop The Fee After The Customer Fulfills The Commitment. If
someone stays the entirety of their commitment, then wants to cancel, they
have earned their free cancellation. It doesn’t stick forever. This makes it
equitable.

I Prefer This Offer For Commitments Of One Year And Longer. The
longer the commitment, the better this works. It works especially well with
services that take a long time to work (SEO, Investing, Weight Loss, etc.). It
keeps people committed when they get emotional.

Cancellation Fees For A…Cause? If you want to keep customers extra
motivated, you can donate it to a cause they are against. Ex: “What cause do
you absolutely hate?...Great. If you cancel early, I will be donating your
setup fee to them.” This gives them two reasons to stay. First, because they
don’t want to shell out the cash. Second, because they don't want a cause
they hate to get it.

Summary Points



● Waived Fee Offers present a month-to-month option with a fee or waive
the fee if they

commit.

● I typically make the fee 3–5x my monthly rate.

● At minimum, the commitment length should be a year.

● The larger your fee, the more buyers will opt for the commitment.
The smaller your fee, the

more up front cash you’ll get.

● If the customer meets the commitment, the fee officially goes away.



Continuity Offers Conclusion
The only thing better than getting someone to buy once, is getting them to

buy again.

 

Continuity Offers provide ongoing value that customers make ongoing
payments for until they cancel. Many businesses use Continuity Offers to
attract customers for less. But, it crashes 30-day profits. This makes
profitable advertising difficult.

I use Continuity Offers differently. I make them last. I start with profitable
Attraction Offers. Then make my Upsell and Downsell Offers. Then, I offer
Continuity. And if they accept, I upsell a bulk amount of time or product at a
discount. Then, they automatically enter continuity after they’ve used up
their bulk purchase. This way, I make even more cash and I get the
recurring-cash benefits of the other continuity customers.

Continuity Offers work with rewards or punishment. I prefer rewards. And
two of the three Continuity Offers I explained use them. But, there will



always be times when a more traditional contract makes sense. In those
situations, I like Waived Fee Offers.

In the next section we will create our $100M Money Model by combining
all four offer types: Attraction Offers, Upsell Offers, Downsell Offers, and
Continuity Offers. Let’s put a bow on it.

Section VI: Make Your Money Model

How To Take Over Your Entire Market

 

Looking back at the evolution of Gym Launch’s $100M Money Model today.

I accidentally discovered the Gym Launch licensing Money Model. I went
from flying around and filling gyms to licensing the stuff I used when I did
it. This way, gym owners could do it themselves.



Looking back, it all started it with a Decoy Offer. I attracted new
customers with lots of free courses, books, video training, live training, and
so on. All stuff on growing a gym. Each free product came with its own free
call to help gym owners use it. On the call I’d offer:

Decoy Offer: Now that you’ve got the plan, you do it on your own for
free.

Or…

Premium Offer: We can help you implement all this stuff for $16,000 over
16 weeks.

If they took the premium option, they’d get a treasure trove of money-
making tactics. Tactics that took me years to figure out. People bought left
and right. And whoosh, my Decoy Offer took me to $476,000 per month in
three months. Not a typo.

But I had a problem. Since I only had one thing to sell, I knew my revenue
would plateau fast. I needed an upsell to raise profits or Gym Launch would
stagnate. So I crafted an Upsell Offer for the more advanced gym owners. I
called it “Gym Lords” and priced it at $42,000 per year. I used the Classic
Upsell to offer advanced playbooks and services. And a community to share
best practices as a Continuity Bonus. I started by offering a hefty $6,000
discount for anyone who prepaid. Many gym owners paid for it up front with
money I had just made them. For the ones who didn’t, I offered a Payment
Plan Downsell.

If they said no, I went for $10,000 down and spread the rest over time. If
they said no again, I’d go for ~$800 per week for 52 weeks. If they said no
again, I said they could start for free. I’d use a Continuity Discount to
frontload the free time for as long as it took them to finish paying off the
first offer. Then, they’d roll right into my continuity upsell. This way, their
payments stayed continuous. And zoom…The Classic Upsell + Continuity
Bonus + Payment Plan Downsell + Continuity Discount took me to
~$1,500,000 per month.



I had another thing to sell. Woo! And it exploded Gym Launch’s Money
Model to the next level. But, I still had work to do. Even though the upsell
and downsell process worked well, some gym owners kept saying no. I went
back to the drawing board.

I came up with a more personalized Menu Upsell with different levels of
service. I offered done-for-you advertising. I offered sales team training. I
offered turnkey campaigns to make quick cash. And finally, I offered a
minimum package—continuous access to the original Gym Launch materials
with tech support for a discounted monthly rate. If they didn’t want the
whole package, I used Feature Downsells to find the best option for them.
Almost everyone stayed for something.

And wham…Menu Upsells + Feature Downsells took me to $2,300,000
per month. All within 14 months.

Then we started Prestige Labs and integrated it with Gym Launch. A
totally different business with its own Money Model. By month 20, we were
raking in $4,400,000 per month. It was life-changing. And it *only* took a
few darn good products and a $100M Money Model to do it. ***

Author Note: When I started, I didn’t know any of this Money Model
stuff. It only looks clean looking back. But, I hope this simplifies things so it
takes you much less time than it took me.

Description

A Money Model is a deliberate sequence of offers. It’s what you offer,
when you offer, and how you offer it to make as much money as you can as
fast as you can. Ideally, to make enough money from one customer to get
and service at least two more customers in less than 30 days. And it rarely
looks clean, but I break $100M Money Models into three stages:

Stage I: Get Cash—Attraction Offers get more customers for less

Stage II: Get More Cash—Upsell & Downsell Offers make more money
from them faster



Stage III: Get The Most Cash—Continuity Offers maximize their total
money spent

I break my $100M Money Model down into these stages because Money
Model growth happens alongside the growth of the business. In other words,
if you try to start a bootstrapped business, from zero, on your own, with a
“finished” Money Model… it will collapse on top of you. In fact, none of my
businesses started with a fully forged Money Model. They all start at Stage I.
Even Acquisition.com! In my experience, Money Models evolve like this:

● First, I get customers reliably then

● I make sure they pay for themselves reliably then

● I make sure they pay for other customers reliably then

● I start maximizing each customer’s long-term value then

● I spend as many advertising dollars as I can to print as much money
as possible.

My Money Models develop this way because I make sure each stage pays
for the next. We keep improving each stage until it gets reliable. Also, this
means financial and operational reliability. So fair warning: when your
Money Model starts working, your business starts breaking. Part of the
game. So I suggest you find someone who can build and lead the team that
makes your vision a reality. When I did, I married her. I hope the same luck
finds you.

Make Your Own Money Model

 

Step 1) Start With An Attraction Offer. The goal is to turn strangers
into customers and cover our costs. So, figure out what you’re going to sell.
Then, figure out the best way to present it. The Attraction Offer section has
my top favorites: Win Your Money Back, Giveaways, Decoy Offers, Buy X
Get Y Free, Pay Less Now or Pay More Later. Then, advertise it. If you get
leads who turn into customers, you’re on your way. Figuring out what works
best may take up to a year. If you want to learn more about advertising,
make sure to check out my second book $100M Leads.



Step 2) Pick An Upsell Offer. The goal is to get 30-day profits well
above our costs of getting a new customer and delivering what you offer to
them. Remember, once you solve a problem, another appears. Those
problems also need solutions. You solve the problems your Attraction Offer
creates with Upsell Offers. So pick the Upsell Offer that best matches the
problem you solve and how you solve it. The Upsell Offer section gives you
my four favorites: The Classic Upsell, Menu Upsell, Anchor Upsell,
Rollover Upsell. Then, make your offer at their time of greatest need.

Step 3) Pick A Downsell Offer. The goal is to get customers who said no
to your last offer to say yes to another offer. This way, you’ll sell way more
people than you otherwise would—so you make more total cash from the
same number of leads. The Downsell Offer section shows you my three
favorites. If you want to keep your price the same, change how they pay with
Payment Plan Downsells or Trials. If you want to charge less, change what
they get with Feature Downsells. And best of all, you can alternate between
them in the same sale. The more flexible you make your offers, the more
people will buy them.

Step 4) Pick A Continuity Offer. The goal here is to get one last sale in
our 30-day window and stack recurring cash. So, I try to include continuity
in business eventually. My three favorite Continuity Offers are: Continuity
Bonuses, Continuity Discounts, and Waived Fee Offers.

Sometimes the best timing for Continuity Offers happens after the first
thirty days, and that’s OK. It’s better to make the offer at the right time than
to try and force it at the wrong time.

 



Important Notes

Perfect One Offer At A Time. It’s tempting to implement a whole Money
Model at once. Don’t. Stick to your stage. Pick one offer. Try it. Keep doing
it until it works reliably. Then, after it’s reliable, do it so many times it gets
automatic. Then, go to the next stage.

Patience is still the fastest way to get to your goal. So you'll need to
measure in quarters, not weeks. You either build it right or you build it again.
And again. And again. Building again—no matter how fast—still takes
longer than building it right the first time.

Raise Price In Stages. Make new offers cheap at first. Then, as you get
yeses, raise the price. Lots of early yeses get customer feedback and make
the product better. Then, as the offer gets reliable, start raising the price. And
keep raising the price until you cannot make up for the nos with the extra
cash you make from the yeses. In other words, keep raising the price until
you make less money.

Simple Scales. Fancy Fails. Get as much as you can out of what you
have. Remember, it’s less about having 100 products to offer, and more
about having 100 ways to offer your product. Think more ways to sell the
same thing, not more things to sell. If I offer personal training, I can offer
one, two, three, four etc. sessions per week. This turns one product into
many offers.

*IMPORTANT* Affiliate Products Can Fill Money Model Gaps. An
affiliate relationship just means you sell other peoples’ stuff for a
commission. If you don’t have anything to offer, and want to start a business,
you can offer somebody else’s stuff. If you have a single offer, and want to
add more offers to your Money Model, you can offer somebody else’s stuff.
If you have a $100M business, and want to make more money without
adding the operational headache, you can offer somebody else’s stuff. In
short, you can always offer somebody else’s stuff in your Money Model.
Here are a few examples:

● Service: A dental agency sends their dentist clients to a braces
manufacturer. The



manufacturer sends them commissions for each dentist client they send.
More money. No

extra work. Voila.

●
Local Business: A massage therapist sells their clients somebody else’s
home massage tools,
exercise bands, medicine balls, etc. The customer pays through the

therapist, and the other

company ships it right to the customer. A few extra words. A lot of extra
money. No extra

service delivered.

●
Digital Product: An educator tells his clients to use a specific customer
service software. The
software company sends the consultant a commission for every sign-up.

Turn Attraction Offers Into Continuity Offers With Automatic
Renewal. This makes it a two-for-one. For example, if you do a Buy 6
Months Get 6 Months Free Offer, they can roll automatically into a month-
to-month subscription at the end of 12 months. This gets the benefits of
Attraction and Continuity Offers. A small tip with big implications.

You Can Mix And Match Offers However You Want. I present offers
this way because that’s how I use them. But if you recall, I learned many of
them from people who used them differently than me! Many of these offers
you can use anywhere. You can use Upsell tactics in your Attraction Offer.
You can install a Downsell process with every offer. You can use a
Continuity Offer to attract new customers. There are no rules. You can do
whatever you want. I show you stuff one way, but I fully expect you to use it
in another. So, start with the way I suggest it. Then, as you get better,
experiment. It’s how I learned this stuff. And it’s how you’ll learn it too.

Summary



● A Money Model is a deliberate sequence of offers.

● Money Models have three stages: Get Cash (Attraction Offers), Get
More Cash (Upsells &

Downsells), Get The Most Cash (Continuity Offers).

● To make your own Money Model, start with an Attraction Offer.
Once it gets you customers

and cash, add an Upsell Offer. From there, add Downsell Offers to get
even more people to

buy. Then, finally add in your Continuity Offer.

● Do not try and implement a full Money Model at once. It will break
your business.

● Don’t start more businesses just to make more offers. It’s less about
having 100 products to

offer, and more about having 100 ways to offer your product.

● To sell more stuff without starting 100 businesses, offer stuff from other
businesses and let

them deliver.

● Affiliate Relationships can fill gaps in your Money Model without the
headache of delivery.

● Price new offers low enough that you will get lots of yeses. Use
customer feedback to

improve your product. Then, start raising the price until you stop making
more money.

● A $100M Money Model eliminates cash as a bottleneck for growth.
Mission accomplished.

Where Money Models Fit In The Grand Scheme Of Things

My first book, $100M Offers, answered the question: What should I sell?
Answer: an offer so good people feel stupid saying no. My second book,
$100M Leads, answered the next natural question: How do I find these
people? Answer: You advertise. This book, $100M Money Models, answers
the next natural question: How do I get them to buy it? Answer: A Money
Model.

What We Covered

We’ve covered a lot. And I think organizing what we learned into one
place helps it sink in. So I made this “back of the napkin” list of what we’ve
covered and why.



1. A Money Model is a series of offers designed to increase how many
customers you get,

how much they pay, and how fast they pay it.

2. A good Money Model makes more profit from a customer than it costs to
get and service them in the

first 30 days. That’s the bare minimum.

3. A $100M Money Model makes more profit from one customer than it
costs to get and service many

customers in the first 30 days, which removes cash as a limiter to scaling
your business.

4. Money Models have four types of offers: Attraction Offers, Upsell
Offers, Downsell Offers,

and Continuity Offers.

5. Attraction Offers get customers by offering something free or at a
discount. Often, they

also make money by offering a better deal at a higher price. We covered
five.

a. Win Your Money Back: You set a goal for the customer and tell
them how to reach it.

If they reach it, then they qualify to get their money back or get it back as
store credit.

b. Giveaways: You advertise a chance to win a big prize in
exchange for contact

information and anything else you want. After picking a winner, you offer
everyone else the big prize at a discounted price.



c.
Decoy Offers: You advertise a free or discounted offer. When the
lead asks to learn

more, you also present a more valuable premium offer. The
premium offer includes more features, benefits, bonuses,
guarantees, and so on.

d.
Buy X Get Y Free: You offer customers free stuff in exchange for
buying other stuff

for money. The more free stuff and the higher its value, the
more people buy.

e.
Pay Less Now or Pay More Later: You give people a choice to
pay full-price later OR

pay a discounted price now and get additional bonuses.

6. Upsell Offers are whatever you offer next. Typically, more, better, or
newer versions of

what they just bought. These get you more cash fast. We covered four.

a. The Classic Upsell: You offer the solution to the customer’s
next problem the

moment they become aware of it. You can’t have X without Y!

b.
Menu Upsells: You tell customers which options they don’t need.

what theyThen, tell them
do need

and how to get their value from it. You don't need that…you need this.

c.
Anchor Upsells: You offer your most expensive thing first. If the customer

balks, you



offer a much-cheaper-and-still-acceptable-alternative. No worries. If you
don’t care about X, this may be a better fit for you.

d.
Rollover Upsells: You credit some or all of a customer’s previous

your nextpurchases toward
offer.

Since you already spent $500, I’ll just credit that towards you staying a full
year.

7. Downsell Offers are whatever you offer after someone says no. And by
turning Nos into

Yeses you make more money. We covered three.

a.
Payment Plan Downsells: You offer the same product at the same
price, but they pay

some now and the rest over time. When do you get paid? Let’s
do half now and half then?

b. Trial With Penalty: You let customers try your product or
service for free so long as

they meet your terms. If they do, they have a better chance of
becoming paying customers. If they don’t, they pay. If you do
X, Y, Z, I’ll let you start for free.

c.
Feature Downsells: You lower prices by changing what the
customer gets. I offer

lower quantity, lower quality, lower price alternatives, or cut
optional components entirely. If you’re okay without a
guarantee, I can knock off $400.

8. Continuity Offers provide ongoing value that customers make
ongoing payments



for—until they cancel. These boost the profit of every customer and give
you one last thing

to sell. We covered three.

a. Continuity Bonus Offers: You give the customer an awesome
thing if they sign up

today. Typically, the bonus itself has more value than the first continuity
payment. If you sign up today, you also get XYZ valuable thing.

b. Continuity Discount Offers: You give the customer free time,
now or later, if they

sign up today.

c.
Waived Fee Offers: First, you ask the customer to pay a startup

a month-fee as part of joining
to-month

program. Then, you offer to discount the entire fee if they commit longer
term. If they cancel inside the term, they pay the fee.

9. You build Money Models one stage at a time.

a. Once I get customers reliably then I make sure they pay for
themselves reliably then I

make sure they pay for other customers reliably then I start
maximizing each customer’s long-term value. Then, I print as
much money as I can.

Bottom Line: The knowledge in these bullets brought me more free and
profitable customers than I’ve known what to do with. If executed, they will
do the same for you. And with that, cash will no longer constrain your
business. I hope this book helps you grow your dream as big as you darn
well please.



Also, since you are one of the few who actually finish what you start, I
want to leave you with a parting gift: some closing remarks that got me
through hard times.



Final Thoughts
You don’t become confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror. You

become confident by giving yourself a stack of

undeniable proof that you are who you say you are. Outwork your self-doubt.

 

An actual post I made on July 25, 2020. Before I made my life public. ***

Leila snapped this when I wasn’t looking and I was like “DAYUMM I look
pensive AF” 😂

Anyways, this is the second time we’ve taken a private jet.

And...it was dope.

They figure if you go down with the ship, your seatbelt won’t save you.



Regardless—to every entrepreneur who is disappointing their parents,
wives, husbands, friends, fake friends,

and everyone else who doubts you.

#1 I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

#2 It’s about to get real, so get hard fast.

#3 You cannot lose if you do not quit. I used to repeat that to myself over
and over when I didn’t want to

keep doing it.

If you feel hopeless...welcome to entrepreneurship. If you feel like you’ll
never make it...you’re on the right path.

If you feel like you’re a disappointment to everyone you know...Keep.
Moving. Forward.

Because at the end of the rainbow isn’t a pot of gold.

It’s you.

The real you.

That’s been underneath all along whispering in your ear—just one more
step...one more call...one more sale.

When I say I'm your biggest fan, it’s because I was there. And I know you
because I know EXACTLY

what that FEELS like. Having both 100% confidence and 1,000% doubt.
At the same time. Here’s all

you gotta do:

Just keep moving.

Keep fighting.



Keep improving.

Your time will come.

Success is the only revenge.

***

So right now you might be where I was back when I started. Working in a
concrete coffin, under blinding fluorescent lights, wanting to escape. You
might be overwhelmed by all the stuff you have to do to succeed. But with
that uncertainty, know that every entrepreneur, past and present, shoulders
the burden with you. I’ve been there. They’ve been there. You are not alone.
I share these stories as I experienced them so you can benefit from them as I
have.

So here’s my promise: follow the lessons, the money will come.

Be one of zero.

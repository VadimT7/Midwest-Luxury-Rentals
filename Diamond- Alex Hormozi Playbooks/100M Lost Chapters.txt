HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME 
OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY 
BUSINESS WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN 
OR DESCRIBED. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY 
ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL 
PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT 
OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL BUSINESS DOES NOT INVOLVE FINANCIAL 
RISK, AND NO HYPOTHETICAL BUSINESS RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR 
THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER RISK IN ACTUAL BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE 
ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR TO ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR BUSINESS STRATEGY 
IN SPITE OF BUSINESS LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY 
AFFECT ACTUAL BUSINESS RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED 
TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS 
PROGRAM, WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF 
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE. When used herein, this “book” means this book, its contents, 
and all information and ideas contained therein.

$100M LOST CHAPTERS
Lost Treasures From $100M Offers, $100M Leads, & $100M Money Models

Why lost chapters? Well, I wrote them and I thought they were useful. But, they didn’t 
fit into the other books. Main reason: they’ll deepen your knowledge but aren’t required to 
execute the strategies in the $100M Series. That being said, understanding them at a deeper 
level certainly won’t make you poorer. So, that too.

Next important point—this is an unconventional book. This is a compilation of 
unreleased chapters from the $100M Series. I organized them as logically as I could, but 
do not expect the same “through line” my other books have. Think of it more as a sampling 
of different ideas that can be used independently from one another. As such, feel free to 
skip around and read them in the order that’s most useful for you. The core ideas are worth 
providing because they’ll certainly changes a few business owners’ lives. And if that’s you, 
then there’s hardly anything more valuable that I could provide.

Organization

I split this “assortment of chapters” into an intro chapter and four sections: Sections A 
through D. They are as follows.

Intro Chapter: Your first Avatar: This is one of the most important chapters I’ve written. 
I ended up writing it because I got so many questions about avatar selection after I released 
$100M Offers. If I ever write an updated $100M Offers, I will incorporate it into the main 
book. The process I outline in this chapter is not a beginner concept. I use the process 
I outline with every company I advise. It’s that useful. If you’re not sure where to start, 
start here.

$100M Lost Chapters

Section A: Attract goes into more detail on how to use Premium, Free, and Discount 
offers to increase how many people take you up on your thing. I break down each. The pros 
and cons, and a bunch of examples from my experience. I also share some relevant data I’ve 
collected on each type of offer that I think you’ll find valuable. 

Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem explains the math behind Customer-Financed 
Acquisition (CFA). This was the last cut I made to $100M Money Models. Too many people 
got bogged down by the math. But, if you like money math, this explains the powerful 
concept in more detail. It gives you more in-depth examples on how to calculate the three 
main metrics of acquisition: Lifetime Gross Profit (LTGP), Cost to Acquire a Customer 
(CAC), and Payback Period (PPD). If your business doesn’t fit the examples in the $100M 
Money Models book, or if you just want to see more examples to deepen your knowledge, 
then this is for you. 

Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking gives you more money models that I cut from the 
original book, as well as a primer on offer stacking with some in-depth examples I cut in one 
of the later drafts.

Section D: Expanded Employees Stuff is an expanded chapter from $100M Leads: 
“Employees.” I cut this because I thought the chapter began to creep out of the scope of 
getting leads, and into the area of general management. That being said, it is still valuable, 
just not for the $100M Leads book. This chapter is twice the length of the final “Employees” 
chapter and gets into management and performance. To make sure people actually get you 
leads when you pay them, and you get a good return on it. 

Since the sections and chapters don’t have a major through line, I also include a tiny 
blurb before each chapter explaining why I cut it and how it could help you. I hope you 
enjoy them as much as I enjoyed writing them for you.

Lost Chapter Author Note**: If I could go back in time, I would include this chapter in the 
$100M Offers book. It’s incredibly important for figuring out who your ideal customer is. And no, 

this isn’t yo mama’s “find a niche” chapter. This is real, how-you-make-tons-of-money type stuff.

2019 - I can’t remember the month.
The room was cold and dark. Presenters filed on and off stage. We sat at the “cool 

kids” table for business owners who had software over $10,000,000 ARR (annual recurring 
revenue). We felt good about ourselves. Our software company ALAN had recently crossed 
the $1,700,000 per month threshold in its first six months.

As we chatted between speakers, the event host got on stage. “Our next speaker is 
someone everyone should pay close attention to. This man is responsible for over $50 billion 
in sales.” The noise in the room died down. The host continued, “...He is a specialist in 
pricing and profit maximization. He worked for years at Vista, one of the most renowned 
software private equity funds in the world.” Gulp. Reality check. I’m still a minnow.

The speaker broke down the process Vista used to grow companies. Their method was 
unlike any I had heard. Here’s how it worked.

When they consider acquiring a company, they analyze the company’s current customers. 
They look for the customers who stay the longest and pay the most. Then, they score them 
according to this value. The highest scores go to the customers worth the most, the lowest to 
the ones worth the least. If they feel there’s a vein of underserved valuable customers, they 
buy the company.

Once they buy a company, they’d cut channels that brought the low-value customers. 
Then, they double down on the channels that brought in the best ones.

That’s it. More of the high-profit customers. Fewer low-profit customers. Rinse. Repeat. 
When he broke down the math, it became even more obvious. It was Pareto’s principle 

(80/20) on steroids. 20% of customers bring in 80% of revenue. If you replace the 80% 
with those high spenders, you grow the business 5x. No small feat, especially in billion 
dollar companies. I wondered how I could apply this method across our portfolio. Since 
then, it’s become a pillar of our value acceleration method (VAM) at acquisition.com.

Finding the Right Customers

Earlier, I talked about picking the right market. It’s an important strategic business 
decision. Choosing the perfect avatar is a subset of that larger decision. This is where we 
become more nuanced about exactly who we serve, and more importantly, who we do not.

There are four steps to installing this process. I outline them below. Then, I share what 
we found after implementing this in Gym Launch. Here are the steps.

1)	 Survey your customers: Set up a form with the questions below and send it out. Or, 
for higher engagement, go over it with them live at an event or on a call. Make sure 
they show they completed it to receive some benefit. Ask them every relevant detail 
you’d want to know. Here’s an example of questions I would ask business services 
customers:

a)	 Demographics: Who are they? Age? Gender? Political affiliation? Geographic 
location? Digital Location? Single/Divorced? Partnered in business or 
solopreneur?

b)	 Business Stats Before & Current: Revenue? Profit? # of employees? Churn? 
Pricing? Products? Customer lifetime value? # of customers? Niche? How 
long in business?

c)	 Aspirations: What was their goal upon purchasing your services/products? 
What problem were they trying to solve?

d)	 Buying Process: What’s the single biggest reason they bought? Was there a 
trigger event that caused them to buy? Did they consume any specific piece 
of content? Was there a specific testimonial they consumed? How many 
pieces did they consume? When did they first hear about you vs. when they 
bought? Where did they first see us? Did someone refer them?

2)	 Find your biggest spenders: Sort the replies by the customers you like the most, 
spent the most, and stayed the longest. Focus on the top 20%. Ignore the rest.

3)	 See what they have in common: This takes reading through all the answers and using 
your brain. I know. Thinking is hard. The good news is, your competitors won’t 
do it—easy advantage. Goal: Come up with the fewest qualifiers they all have in 
common. Now, list them out. Usually there are three to five qualifiers.

4)	 Execute: Once you have these answers you’re going to do two important things.
a)	 Speak your new avatar. Be up front about your customer requirements. Get 

all advertising to speak directly to them. You will repel the bad customers

Your First Avatar

and attract the good ones. Stop selling anyone who does not meet your 
ideal customer requirements. Seriously, stop it. Then, increase effort on the 
channels these people come through.

b)	 Re-engineer the sales process. Look at what caused these better customers to 
buy. Reverse-engineer the buying process your best customers went through. 
Then, make it happen on purpose.

Pro Tip: You Make More Because of Who They Are, Not Because of 
Who You Are

The profit you make comes from the premium you can charge for your stuff. 
The price reflects this premium. You can increase the price if you increase the 
value. The beauty of selling to better customers means you provide more value 
for the same work. Let me explain. You can charge more because of who they 
are, rather than who you are.

Quick Example. Imagine you’re a sales page designer. Let’s say you improved a 
sales page to convert from 5% conversion to 7%. As a result, your client makes 
more money. Let’s look at the value you provide two different customers for 
the same work. If company A made $100,000 per month from the page, they 
now make $140,000 per month. If company B made $10,000,000 per month, 
they’d now make $14,000,000 per month. You work the same amount in both 
cases. But, you provided more value to company B (by a lot). And, you could 
charge for it. Let’s say you charged 10% of growth. For the first business, you’d 
make $40,000 per year. Not bad. From company B, you’d make $4,000,000 per 
year. Much better. You gotta think different to make crazy money. Serving the 
right customer is one of those ways.

Pro Tip: What To Do If You Have No Customers - Start With What 
You Know

Want to know how the best venture capitalists invest in startups? They pick the 
founders with past experience relative to the industry they want to serve. This 
makes sense. There’s a lot of in-depth knowledge that takes time to learn. A fast 
track for new entrepreneurs is to start with the industry you know the most 
about. Most of us have *some* inside knowledge due to friends, family, past 
jobs, etc. Even within that subset, you just want to pick the people you can help 
the most. Create a narrow target, then serve them first. Don’t get fancy. Start 
with what you know, then branch out over time as you learn more. You can run 
the customer analysis process again once you have more customers to survey. 

Here’s what happened after we did it. We did steps one through three. We surveyed. 
We sorted for the biggest spenders. Saw what they had in common. Then executed. Please 
find below the results of this activity on our Gym Launch business.

Findings from Steps 1–3 about our best customers:

Demographics: Right leaning/conservative, married, 25–45, male, gym owner, 
US-based
Business Requirements: Signed lease, 1+ employees minimum, $10,000+ per month 
revenue minimum when starting, minimum 30 existing clients
Aspirations: $1M+ gym, not work so much, open more locations
Buying Reasons: Not enough leads, “bad market,” bad pricing, can’t find good 
employees

Step 4a: New Redefined Avatar: We surveyed our customers to see what the top 
20% had in common. In other words, we got to see what our most successful 
customers looked like. Actions: We focused on the audiences that had the highest 
concentration of these types of gym owners. We spelled out our requirements in our 
ads and pages. We talked only about the specific problems and aspirations of our 
best customers, rather than all customers.

Findings from Steps 1–3 about how they bought: 

After looking at the data, we found that 78% of our top customers had consumed 
AT LEAST TWO pieces of long-form content before purchasing from us. This means 
that if we got on the phone with someone who had not done that, our chances of 
selling them were lower. 

Step 4b: Reverse-engineer buying process. Actions: My team then recreated this 
“ideal” buying experience. From this point onwards, we injected two long-form 
high-value content pieces to each lead as a part of their buyer journey. And, we 
increased our total output of content. On top of that, we created a list of our 
“all-time greatest hits” of content to arm the sales team. They then hand select two 
to three pieces they think could help the prospect. By doing that, they forced them 
to go through the same buying process that caused our best customers to buy. Note: 
They were not disguised sales pitches, they were genuinely value-in-advance content. 
(Like this, hopefully). 

A Comparison

A while back, I considered buying an equity stake in a business services company that 
served fitness business owners. I spent the morning with the business owner learning about 
his business metrics. From speaking with him, I discovered that despite the owner serving 
the same vertical as me, and making the same number of total sales, he was making 70x less 
profit (yes, seventy times less!) Spoiler: it wasn’t because we’re brilliant. It’s because figuring 
out the most valuable customers to sell to works. 

The difference. They accepted anyone with a pulse and a credit card. As a result, they 
dealt with high customer churn, high costs of acquisition, low retention rates, and lower 
satisfaction scores. And it had to be that way. Compared to ours, their advice was generic. 
On the other hand, we selectively pursued and catered to the highest value customers. We 
ignored all others. This gave us higher retention, higher gross margins, premium pricing, 
and lots of repeat business. Same market. Different customer segmentation. Monstrously 
different results. This stuff matters.

Quality > Quantity

Many competitors try to recreate our buyer journey. However, they don’t fully commit. 
They panic, then cut out steps to get more volume. This is often a mistake. In my experience, 
every time we removed qualification steps, our lead volume increased, but we made less 
money. Merging marketing and sales into one acquisition department solved this problem 
for good. Marketing stopped complaining that the sales team wasn’t closing. Sales team 
stopped complaining that they wanted more leads. Everyone came together to focus on 
what mattered: closing lots of valuable deals. We now use the optimal amount of steps to 
generate the highest return on advertising over the long haul. 

Example: I would rather pay $5,000 to acquire $45,000 than pay $1,000 to acquire 
$5,000 (even though it costs five times as much). 

Knowing your ideal buyer journey forces patience. You see the business holistically, 
rather than as a widget to be sold to as many people as possible. The ladder is how small 
newbie entrepreneurs think—don’t think like that. 

To give some context, the average Gym Launch competitor has a lifetime gross profit 
(LTGP) of around $6,000–$8,000. I know because I’ve looked at buying their businesses. 
Our LTGP is north of $45,000. Now despite the LTGP being *only* 6–8x higher, the 
subsequent profits that occur as a result are breathtakingly different. For a moment, I want 
you to imagine 8x your price, and keeping your costs the same. How much more profit 
would you be making? Probably a lot. That’s the difference. 

Once you narrow down your focus, you serve fewer customers in the short term. This 
may mean a short-term decrease in revenue (due to the cost of change). But over the long 
haul, you get a long term with higher retention and profitability. And unless you’re planning 
on quitting business, why wouldn’t you make the right long-term call?

 Pro Tip: Sell To People Who Don’t Stop Buying

Fortunes are created when we sell things that customers don’t stop buying. So 
our goal should be either to improve our product so everyone wants to keep 
buying. Or, only sell to customers who historically keep buying. Either solution 
works. But, this chapter relates only to changing your avatar. 

Note: There’s a reason companies that have enterprise clients tend to get higher 
multiples. Reason: they deal with better customers who can afford more, have 
resources to deploy, and are generally easier to deal with than bottom-feeders. 
And most importantly, once they start buying, they tend to continue to buy. 

How to Use This Chapter to Get More High Quality Leads Immediately 

You have three actions to do at the end of this chapter to get more leads. First, survey 
your existing customers. Next, use this data to decide which characteristics are leading 
indicators of high-value customers. Finally, use this information to change your messaging 
in your advertising, and re-engineer a sales process for them specifically. 

Over the long haul, this increases the quality and quantity of your lead flow. It also 
increases your average customer value as you are weeding out all the less-than-qualified 
potential customers up front. 

Growing a business comes down to selling more customers or making them worth more. 
This chapter accomplishes both. You get more clients because your marketing becomes more 
tailored. And, you make your clients worth more by exclusively selling the highest value 
people. It feels like cheating because it’s so obvious. But here’s the great part—no one does it. 
Getting this step right will act as a force multiplier on the remaining contents in this book.

Now that we know who we are looking for, is there any other way we can scale our 
avatar? Short answer—Yes. And we will tackle that on our next adventure.

SECTION A: ATTRACT
How To Get People To Engage, Who Otherwise Wouldn’t, Using Free & Discount Promotions

Lost Chapter Author Note**: I cut the next three chapters from $100M Money 
Models because they were a little too theoretical. Although I love theory, concepts, 

and frameworks, I don’t think a lot of people need them. People just need to 
know what to do. But if you like understanding the principles I cycle through 

to create promotions that crush…these next three chapters are for you.

March 2016.
I stood to the side of the stage. I looked back at the thousands in the crowd. No one 

knew me. I was 26 at the time. Most were older than me. I checked the clock. I was up soon. 
My heart thumped so loud I heard it in my ears.

The emcee read his notes to introduce me. I planned to talk about how I pre-sold each 
of my gyms to full capacity before opening, with no money out of pocket. I repeated my 
talking points in my head.

Please welcome to the stage Alex Hormoziiiiiii.
My name snapped me into focus. I was up. I stepped on stage. The bright lights shone in 

my eyes. One thought calmed me, “At least I only have to talk about something I know.”
I began. My slides were bare. Black and white text with a few images. I felt silly seeing 

all the other speakers’ presentations. They were all so professional. And here I was, a kid in a 
neon green fitness t-shirt who had been broke only a few years before.

So, I explained the same process I had outlined at the beginning of $100M Money 
Models about our Free 6 Week Challenge. How it worked and the numbers behind it. I told 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 11



Section A: Attract

everyone exactly what we did, and how we did it. I’m pretty sure I ended my speech with 
“So yea, that’s it.”

When I got off the stage, I exhaled a sigh of relief. As I tried to exit the venue, everyone 
was leaving too. To my surprise, I got mobbed. The talk transformed me from an unknown 
kid to someone worth listening to. People surrounded me several rows deep, firing questions.

Do you have a course? Do you have a coaching program? Can you do what you just went over 
at my gym? My friend has a gym, is there something of yours I can send him?

It was unlike anything I’d ever experienced. It took me 60 minutes to make it from the 
door of the venue to the men’s lavatory 30 feet away. And even there, someone followed me 
and asked me questions while I was peeing.

My answer remained the same “Nope. I’m only a gym owner. This is what I do. I don’t 
teach it. That’s not my business. Sorry.”

For the next two days, people asked an unending stream of questions about my 
presentation. Every time I found myself alone, a new person would dart over, “got a sec?” It 
felt pretty cool. No one had ever paid me that much attention. And as far as I was concerned, 
I didn’t know anyone else liked this stuff. The marketing world was so new to me.

To this day, I still don’t know why folks at that conference took so much interest in me. 
But I was on my own. I had nothing else scheduled. And it was nice to be recognized as 
“good at this”. It was my first sign that there could be more for me.

The event was my first big exposure. It also went hand in hand with what my mentor 
at the time had suggested I do. “You should be teaching other people how to do what you do.”

 I walked away from the event with a pocket overflowing with business cards and tons 
of new contacts saved in my phone. ‘John M - Guy with beige jacket - supplements’ and 
‘Marcy-owns weight loss clinic - texas’. 

Once I got home, I plugged all the names into a spreadsheet. There were over 100! 
I had no idea what I was doing, but I knew I could probably help them. So I reached out 

to them about a week after the event. Many were in adjacent industries like chiropractors 
or dentists. Some were selling supplements online. Others had online fitness businesses. 
I didn’t know anything about that, at the time. I just knew how to help gyms.

Ironically, the concept of selling a course or program seemed very foreign to me. I had 
always sold services. But, I had no idea how I would do that here. So I created the first offer 
for what would later become Gym Launch by giving something away for free: me.

I’ll fly out to your gym. I’ll spend my own money on marketing, I’ll work your leads. I’ll close 
them. Then I get the cash that I collect, and I’ll give you the customers for free. I’ll show you how 
to sell supplements. I’ll give you my nutrition program. I’ll show you how to fulfill them. And I’ll 
show you how to convert them into memberships. Again, for free. I only make what I sell. 

Sounds like a Grand Slam Offer? Yep. 
I did this for 33 gyms and it took me 18 months of flying around the country to do this 

model. As you can imagine, it was easy to sell. After all, it was free. It’s how I made my first 
million dollars (outside of my gyms).

And I made it all, starting with a free offer. 

Why I Use Free & Discount Promotions 

Whenever I get into a new market, I almost always start with something free or massively 
discounted. I do this for a few reasons. First, I don’t know what I’m doing yet, and don’t 
want to sell people something until I’m certain it’s exceptional. This gives me wiggle room 
and forgiveness if it’s still a little rough around the edges. Second, I like having testimonials, 
and the fastest and easiest way to do that is work for free in exchange for testimonials. Third, 
if I haven’t done something before, I tend to lack conviction. So offering it for free or at 
some massive discount helps me actually close the first few sales (don’t be mistaken, I still 
had to sell people on taking that offer). Fourth, when you start for free, it’s also easy to get 
referrals and start generating demand. 

Get Flow. Monetize Flow. Then Add Friction.

Given those reasons, understanding how to promote your Grand Slam Offer is core to 
getting initial traction and generating your first leads. From there, you can add friction and 
monetize more aggressively. That being said, if I can continue to build in more Grand Slam 
Offers to upsell someone over time, I will keep my front end as low as possible to keep my 
lead flow cranking. This is how I do business. I try to generate demand first then I figure out 
how to make money on it. I feel like too many people try to put the cart before the horse. 

In almost every industry I profit from, I begin with a standalone offer, free offer, or a 
discount offer. They live at the core of my “get new clients” strategy. 

So I’ll cover each of the three of those in that order. Just remember, free and discount are 
wrappers around the core premium offer we created. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 13



Section A: Attract

I’m not saying you have to do this. I’m saying this is how I do it, and it has served me 
well. If you want to make money fast, ironically, many times it comes fastest from giving 
things away. Those who give the most, get the most. 

Important: The point of creating a promotion is to enhance your Grand Slam Offer, not 
change it. Think of these like wrapping paper. You can wrap a gift in recycled newspaper or 
you can put it in a Chanel bag with matte black paper and a perfectly tied white bow. What’s 
inside may be the same, but we are making it more inherently attractive. That is the reason 
for our promotional wrapper. This is especially important when entering cold markets when 
you must give people a reason to move towards you. It must answer the critical question—
what’s in it for me. We are making it more attractive to a cold audience in order to generate 
demand flow. 

Over the next three chapters we will break down Premium, Free, and Discount offers in 
more detail. 

So—let’s learn more about how to make those offers the right way.

Presenting Your Grand Slam Offer On Its Own

Some things in life are priceless. For everything else, there’s Mastercard.  
‒ Famous Advertising Campaign

I walked into the smoothie shop where I worked. My friend sat in the back leafing 
through a magazine (because magazines were still a thing). I had my lunch in my hand for 
later, a burger and some waffle fries from next door. 

“You wouldn’t believe this,” he said. “Check this out. This dude bought a burger for 
$50,000. That’s insane.”

The burger had gold flakes and exotic caviar on it. But what I remembered thinking at 
the time was, “how much money did this guy make to be able to buy a $50,000 burger?”

“Who bought it?”
“I don’t know, some hedge fund manager dude. They said he makes like $50 million 

dollars a year.”
50 million dollars. The idea stunned me for a moment as I tried to wrap my head around 

the size of that number. That was almost $1 million dollars per week. 
When I did the math, I realized if he worked 2,000 hours in a year, he 

made $25,000/hr. It cost him two hours of his time to afford the burger. 
Then I did the math on my own income of $6.75/hr. It would cost me the same two hours 
to afford a burger, fries, and a soda with tax from the place next door—$13.50. 

To him, given his income, it wasn’t even insane, it was the same as me buying a burger. 
That’s when I realized the power of infinite returns. Basically that there is no cap on the 

upside, but you can only go down to zero when pricing. 
Premium offers work much the same way. While everyone buys traffic on their 

“$6.75/hr” budget, you buy traffic with your “$25,000/hr” budget. And the best part is, 
you don’t need nearly the volume. 

Here’s what ends up happening in reality. Let’s say one business makes $100 per 
sale ($50 profit) and another business makes $10,000 per sale ($9,500 profit). To make 
equivalent amounts of profit, business #1 needs to sell 190 people at $50 profit to make 
$9,500. Business #2 only needs to sell one. Here’s how it would work in the real world. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 15



Section A: Attract

If you spoke to those same 190 sales that business #1 closed and offered them all the $10,000 
offer instead, you would likely close about 5%. 

Here’s the basic math:
5% x 190 = 9.5 sales
9.5 sales x $9,500 profit = $90,250  
Compared to:
190 sales x $50 profit = $9,500
$90,250/$9,500 = 9.5x as profitable.
As a result, using a high-value offer would make your advertising 9.5x more profitable. 

So even though the volume is far lower, you end up making far more, even when normalized. 
And you only have to deal with nine or ten clients instead of 190, which makes life way 
easier. 

That is the power of premium offers, and that is how they can crush. 
The big caveat is that you need to: 
1) Have something very valuable to provide (your Grand Slam Offer)
and
2) Have a selling process that demonstrates that value.

If I Lost Everything And Had To Start Over . . . 

If I needed to make money, or make a business owner money, I would not start with 
a premium offer. I would add on a free or discount money model. Over time, as your 
reputation improves, you can remove those things. But in the beginning, they are essential 
for most. Earlier in my career, all my offers were free offers. 

The offer I ran with after my original free offers was this:
“Apply & Book a call to see if you qualify for our services.”
Not. Attractive. At. All. 
But, the copy before the offer filtered for the best gym owners that understood it was 

expensive.

Premium Promotions

And remember that one of the biggest advantages with premium offers is the size of the 
ticket you can sell.  

There’s nothing below $0. You can’t go lower. But you can go infinitely higher. 
If you’re new, start with a free or discount offer to get business in the door. Prove results. 

Then, restructure to a premium offer afterwards. 
Note: You can also layer offers together—as we go over at the end of $100M Money 

Models. Premium offers work well as the “second” offer you give after a free offer. But they’ll 
only work if you demonstrated value in the first offer. 

Goal of Premium Offers

The goal of premium offers is to sell the client the best outcome available for themselves. 
You ask the client to buy the thing that will most likely result in them achieving the greatest 
outcome. That being said, this is not “better” or “worse” than any of the other offer options. 
It’s just different. 

For the following “Pros and cons” section, I’m going to flip the script. You’re gonna 
teach me the pros and cons of a premium offer as though we were working together. Thanks 
for keeping me on my toes!

Pros of Premium Offers

#1 Simplest Math & Fewest Moving Parts
Me: Why would we do this really expensive thing? I doubt many people can afford it?
You: If you’re only selling one core “thing,” then the math gets pretty simple. You pay 

$XXXX for YY Leads/Calls/Appts, and you close Z sales @ $VVVV money. That’s about it. 
You just look at what you spent and what you made. 

Me: Ah, okay. I get it. Having fewer things to sell makes this easier because I only sell 
this one expensive thing.

#2 Only “Quality” Customers: Decreases Operational Drag
Me: But we’re only going to have a handful of customers compared to a cheaper model?

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 17



Section A: Attract

You: People who come in on premium offers are, in general, the most qualified customers. 
This decreases the amount of “sifting through the poo” to get the best customers. We “skim” 
with the marketing, but by doing so you pay a premium for the cream instead of all the milk.

Me: Okay, I get it. So we’re okay with the fact that we might only sell 10% as much 
lemonade. Because the lemonade we sell will be more profitable, and our clients will be 
easier to deal with. That sounds like a good thing.

#3 No Discounts or Incentives: High Lead Quality
Me: So we’re not going to give any incentive?
You: Anyone who comes in on this type of offer is expecting to be sold. So there are very 

transparent intentions on both sides. It comes down to how much they believe we can solve 
their problem and the perceived value of our solution.

Me: Alright, so I may get fewer leads, but they will be way higher quality. So I should 
convert a higher percentage of them. Well that sounds good! I don’t want to deal with 
crappy leads all day! 

Cons of Premium Offers

#1 Most Expensive Cost Per Lead/Can Take More Time To Break Even
Me: But if these leads are more expensive, how can we afford them?
You: It costs a lot of money to get moving on this. Many don’t have the cash to drive 

volume with these offers. It also takes time to get the sales process down when starting out. 
And with each opportunity costing us so much more, we have less room for error.

Me: Hmmm...okay, so we need to really know what we’re doing here OR have a decent 
amount of money to burn learning. 

#2 Must Be a Good Copywriter and Understand Your Avatar Well
Me: So how much do I need to know in order to sell our $900 per month bundle?
You: When getting into a new market, it can be hard to understand the inner workings 

of a new avatar. Their deep desires and fears. Their everyday struggles. Here’s a two-second 
example: I wouldn’t say “working hard” in your business, I’d say “cleaning the bathrooms 
yet again.” Specificity is what gives copy its edge. Unless you know the real world of your 
avatar, it can be difficult to get them to bite without a compelling offer and great copy. Free

and Discount offers give us more margin for error on your copy because the offer can push 
people on the fence, over the edge.

Me: Okay, so I need to really study these health nuts and high performance folks to 
know what their real desires and fears are. Okay, so I need to talk in terms of that, not our 
lemonade. And the more specific I can be, the more it will resonate with them and make 
them want to buy our more premium offer. They need to understand why it’s important not 
to drink lemonade that isn’t sourced from our lemonade orchards with our alkalinity profile. 
Otherwise, they’ll just think we’re overpriced Minute Maid. Got it.

#3 Must Be Good at Sales Because This Is a Good Old Fashioned Sale
Me: Since I have no discount or anything, how am I going to get these folks to give us 

money when they’ve never tried it?
You: The conversion process end-to-end must be dialed in. The sales process will need to 

be structured based on the client avatar we’re pursuing. But, for now, understand that when 
we want to lead with premium offers, we should already have a proven process or have some 
cash nested away to get one figured out.

Me: Alright, got it. This is a recurring theme. I need to know what I’m doing.  

#4 Least Efficient Way to Capture a Marketplace
Me: But I feel like so many fewer people will buy at this price point, even if we do make 

a lot of profit?
You: If we are looking for volume, a straight premium offer is going to have to hit a lot 

of eyeballs before getting a bite. This means we show your ads to more people for a smaller 
volume of results. A more valuable result, but lower volume nonetheless.

Me: Okay, so we may make good money, we’re just not going to be the volume leader 
in the lemonade category. This is a strategic question of how we want to run the business. 
I understand.

#5 Must Have an Extremely Compelling Offer of a Result
Me: So I have no discounts or trial offers to give people. How am I going to get them to 

say yes??
You: To optimize our conversion, we may have a small number of people raise their 

hands and say they are interested in your offer. As a result, you will need to make sure that 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 19



Section A: Attract

you have a truly irresistible offer they are getting for their package. Packed with bonuses, 
creative guarantees, and premium support to merit the higher cost.

Me: Okay, so all that stuff we did from $100M Offers is paying off here. We’re going to 
make our offer so compelling it still feels like a deal compared to how much they’re getting. 
Okay, I may have to include some guarantees and give them more bonuses to other things 
they probably would like as well so this still feels like a steal. Got it. 

Conclusion

Premium offers are powerful. They can act as standalone offers that will make you 
money. You don’t really need anything else. If you have clients coming in already, using this 
new structure will allow you to 3–5x your prices without changing your services (seriously). 
Read $100M Offers for more information on how to do this. 

But if you’re just starting out, or your volume isn’t high enough, or your cost of acquisition 
is higher than you can bear currently, then you will likely want to wrap your premium offer 
with a free or discount wrapper. 

So let’s talk about those. 

20 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Free Promotions

“If it’s free, it’s for me!”

Free is the most powerful offer of all time and will never expire. Why? At its base it 
is “something for nothing” or “value in advance”. In fact, researcher Dr. Dan Ariely 
demonstrated something he called the “penny gap”. Basically, he showed that 9x more people 
would take a free Hershey kiss than one sold for a penny. Imagine getting 9x more leads by 
lowering your discount from .01 to free. That’s a big difference. And we’re gonna harness it.

Most marketers have experienced this first hand. Getting a page to convert on a $1 offer 
versus a free offer can be a landslide of a difference. That said, making a free offer is the 
fastest way to see if anyone wants your thing. Because if your free offer doesn’t work, it just 
shows you that prospects either:

1)	 Don’t want your thing—which means you should change what you are giving away 
for free (or how you describe it)

2)	 Don’t believe you.
3)	 Aren’t actually seeing it because you are fishing in the wrong pond. This can be a 

targeting issue. (Ex. = running a single ladies promotion to an audience of married 
moms).

A famous marketer actually tested #2 to prove the point. Once every few years he 
would run an offer in the newspaper that said, “For every $100 you give me I will give you 
$1,000 back, call 444-444-4444.” No one ever responded. He did it to illustrate the point 
of believability. It’s an amazing offer. But it was so good, it was unbelievable. That’s why 
whenever you give a crazy free offer away, you will always have to answer the next question: 
Why? Give a good enough reason, and people will believe you. “Going out of business, all 
products must go in 30 days” is a very good reason to have “90% off all products”. If you 
just said 90% off all products, you likely wouldn’t get the same response. So—as long as it’s 
true—give them a good reason. I go into more depth about this in $100M Leads, Engage 
Your Leads Chapter, “c) Fraternity Party Planner (my favorite) - Make Up A Reason.”

Now, let’s break down some of the pros and cons of free offers. We’re gonna flip the 
script to keep it interesting. Let’s pretend we’re starting a lemonade stand together. And you 
are my mentor. You’ll be teaching me, the ever-hungry student, all about Free promotions.

Pros of Free Offers

#1 Highest Lead Volume
Me: So if we want the most leads, we should lead with a free offer?
You. Exactly. If we need volume, nothing works better than free. It gets the most leads 

per eyeball. And that’s always useful, especially in a small marketplace— like a local market. 
And this should make sense. If we only have X eyeballs in a market, then we want as many 
people to show interest as possible. Free offers get the most people possible interested in 
your “thing”.

Me: Alright. So, if I want to get the most potential leads, free is the way to go. It gets the 
best, middle, and worst caliber people—in one shot. Then, I get the opportunity to sell as 
many of them as I can.

#2 Lowest Lead Cost
Me: So not only will we get the most volume, we’ll also get the cheapest leads??
You: Yes, just by the same logic. You pay for the same amount of eyeballs, but get a 

higher percentage of those people raising their hands. Your cost per raised hand is less, 
making “Free” the source of highest volume and by extension lowest cost.

Me: Sounds like my kind of play. Groovy.

#3 Massive Companies Become Massive & Viral By Learning To Monetize “Free”
Me: But won’t this make us not legit?
You: Nope. Some of the biggest companies in the world use Free front ends. They rely 

on how good their stuff is to get people to keep buying after they try it. Here are just a 
few examples:

. . . Facebook: “Free to sign up and always will be”

. . . YouTube: “Watch & Create Videos for Free”

. . . Dropbox: “Free X Storage”

. . . Uber: “Free First Ride”

. . . Netflix: “Free 30 Days”

. . . Free Ear Piercings (Claire’s)

. . . Free Wax (European Wax Center)

22 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Free Promotions

. . . Free Month (Public Storage)
The list could go on.
Me: Okay—so the point is, learning to profit from free offers will lower cost of acquiring 

a customer (CAC) and create high return on ad spend (ROAS) for our business. Basically, 
how much it costs us to make money. Got it. Then what’s the downside??

Cons of Free Offers

#1 Volume Can Be A Double-Edged Sword
Me: So won’t all these leads create some other issues for our business? I don’t even know 

if I could handle calling all these people...
You: For some businesses, free can attract “too many” prospects. So we may need to add 

friction or make the offer less appealing. We also might not be able to handle the volume 
operationally. For example, if we have manual processes like you meeting with X people 
per day, it could be a problem. So we add friction. Friction increases lead quality. The more 
hoops someone has to go through the higher the quality becomes. So the key with free 
is learning to find the sweet spot on friction to maximize quality volume. Here are a few 
examples of friction to increase quality of prospects:

Examples of Friction:
1) Increased Qualifications. Ex: “To take advantage of this offer you must be 
over 25 years old, employed, and a homeowner.” If you list out qualifications, it 
decreases your volume but increases your quality. This is friction you can add to your 
advertising at all points. You’ll want to repeat the same qualifications everywhere. 
Think: the copy, the creative, the landing pages they see, etc.

2) Increased Information Requirement & Types of Questions: Ex: “Please fill 
out this 20 question application before booking a time to speak with our team.” 
The more required information, the more friction you add. Not only that, but the 
type of information you request increases the friction. For example, “First name” 
is not as “heavy” of an ask as a cell phone number or an income-related question. 
Beyond that, the format they use to answer can increase or decrease the friction. For 
example, multiple-choice creates less friction than open-ended long-form questions. 

3) Increased Number of Steps: If you make someone take more steps, fewer people 
will take them. Prospects will drop off at each point. So, you’ll get fewer, higher 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 23



Section A: Attract

quality people. And you may lose otherwise qualified people. For example: a one-step 
email opt-in will get more people than a 5-step form. This counts double if they have 
to certify their age, fill out a form, watch a video, then schedule themselves. That’s 
why finding the “sweet spot” is so important. You want just enough to weed out the 
weirdos but not so much that you lose some lazy whales.

4) Forced Consumption: Forcing a prospect to consume sales material is my
favorite way to increase quality. But, it cuts volume. With technology, we can force
a prospect to watch a 40-minute video before any call to action appears on the page. 
By doing this we only allow in people who have been pre-indoctrinated. This is a
good strategy when you advertise to a large audience and eyeballs are cheap. That
said, in other settings the volume is just too low to justify this friction. You can also
add it between steps later on once you’ve earned a little more attention from the
prospect. This accomplishes the same goal, a different way. Ex: between a first and
second meeting. No matter how you do it, forcing consumption cuts volume but
increases lead quality. 

5) Advertisement Length: This is a close cousin of forced consumption but different
enough that it’s worth outlining. The length of your ads, copy, and videos before
they see the call to action increases lead quality. The simple time commitment alone
increases friction. Ex: Watching a two-hour video instead of a 30-second video
increases friction. You will get fewer clicks, but those clicks will be worth more.

Me: Oh my. What a thorough answer you provided me here. I can think of a whole host 
of ways of using friction to dial in our lead process to get it “just right” for selling our offer.

#2 Some People Have No Intention of Buying.
Me: But won’t some people just be here for the free stuff and not want to buy??
You: Yes, this can waste resources if we are giving something away that has an actual 

cost. Ideally we avoid these scenarios, which is why offer design is so important. But it still 
always comes down to math: 

Free Money Math
If you spend $1,000 on ads 
Get 500 Leads

24 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Free Promotions

Half are unqualified (250)
And half are qualified (250)

Compared to . . . 
$1,000 on ads
Get 200 Leads
80% Qualified (160)
20% Unqualified (40)

Which campaign was better? Our team may feel better about #2, but according to 
pure dollars and cents, #1 is better. So, make sure to provide value without overextending 
ourselves. This way, we can use the higher volume and let friction skim the cream off the 
top. This is how we harness the power of free.

Me: Got it. So—as long as the math makes sense, I’ll still probably make more sales, I’ll 
just have to wade through some tire kickers. But, I can create some friction to reduce those 
guys. And worst case, I make sure my free offer doesn’t overextend us but is still valuable 
enough to get them to want it. Exciting!

Free Brings Broke People Myth

Hopefully you saw some of the pros and cons on free from our little example. Personally, 
I’m a huge fan of free offers. A friend once joked to me “Everything you sell is free and yet 
somehow you end up making money!”

Because I am such a fan of free offers, I want to take a moment and pound any limiting 
beliefs you have about “free” into dust.

When we showed gyms how to use free offers, they’d say... “They’re all gonna be freebie 
seekers and not my ideal customer.” 

Right and wrong. 
We’ve run four independent split tests of free versus premium offers. Each test had 10 

representative markets.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 25



Section A: Attract

You know what was the same between both…the gyms’ sales closing percentage. As in, 
if they had 10 “free” offer respondents versus 10 “non-free” offer respondents, the close rate 
was the same. So being “non-free” offered no advantage in close rates or average ticket size 
over “free”. 

But you wanna know what wasn’t equal between the two? The volume and cost of the 
leads. Most times going from a non-free to a free front end decreased lead costs by five times 
or more.

Pro Tip: Free Makes More Money

The reason the math is in favor of free is that most times people want to run a 
premium offer and sell at “free offer” prices. That’s where you get messed up. 
If you know the lead cost is going to be 5–10x higher for a premium offer, your 
prices should be at least 5–10x higher. This may be hard to grasp emotionally, 
but it’s just math. 

You need to make what you are selling worth more if you want to play with 
premium offers. It is the #1 mistake I see when people are comparing them. 
They are not fair comparisons, the Price, Prospect, Process, Promotion, and 
Product should ALL reflect a Free offer structure or a Premium offer structure. 
You can’t just mix and match, they are entirely different acquisition strategies. 
But, despite this, I have run the tests with the same price point. Free beats 
premium hands down unless they’ve truly mastered the art of high-ticket selling.

That being said, I’m not saying free is for every offer, every time. But, I am saying that if 
you learn how to harness it, there are some ways to layer “free” into a powerful money model.

Bottom line: If I only had one offer to make to convert or my family would be killed, 
it would be a free offer. I’d rather wade through crappy leads, then figure out how to add 
friction, than look at an empty calendar. 

Now that we’ve covered “Free,” in the next chapter we’ll explore the pros and cons of 
Discount offers.

26 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Discount Promotions

A discount turns wants into haves. Why pay more when you could pay less?

Understanding Discount Offers

Fundamentally, “free” and “discount” offers operate very similarly from a money model 
perspective. Basically, they create a perceived value discrepancy that on its own can drive 
action. That being said, I personally am not a big believer in “marginal” discounts (say 5 to 
25% off). It’s just not enough to drive real behavior in my opinion, and basically just cuts 
into margin. 

Instead, we’re going to be talking about massive discounts (50% or more). Those are 
the types of numbers that people respond to. And they drive action from a population 
that wouldn’t otherwise act. And that’s what you have to accomplish with a free or discount 
offer—it has to get people who wouldn’t otherwise consider it to respond. 

Note: most of the time when talking about discount offers, they will only make up 
a component of your offering, not the entire thing. While there are a handful of notable 
exceptions, in most instances a discount offer is a “piece of the thing,” not the “entire thing”. 
With hope, that makes sense. If it doesn’t, the examples will illustrate it. 

Four Ways To Display Discounts

So let’s imagine we start a lemonade stand. I say to you, “I want to try one of these 
discount offers out. What do you think? I think we’ll be able to get more people to respond 
to my efforts with some sort of discount, but I don’t know where to start...” 

“Great question. You’re going to have to test it, but I’ll show you the framework that I 
use to test discounts. It’ll automatically get you thinking differently about how to display 
offers from here on out.

“You see, there are four ways you can display a discount. Knowing them is important. 
People will respond differently to the same discount displayed differently. There are probably 
others, but these are the four that I find most common and have been tested and used 
effectively. Let’s look at our own business and try all four. You’ll notice that sometimes it 
‘fits’ and other times it doesn’t. Whether we are selling something premium or in higher 
volume, the price of the offer many times informs what will make the most sense for us.”

Section A: Attract

Let’s imagine we have an ultimate lemonade bundle that is three bottles a day for $30 per 
day (the numbers don’t matter). Well, that’s what we’re going to promote four different ways.
“New Client Special” First Week of Lemonade $29 Instead of $210

1)	 Percentage Off
a)	 Percentage Off: “New Client Special,” 87% off first visit

2)	 Absolute Amounts Off
a)	 Absolute Amount Off: “$181 Off First Week” (Normally $210)

3)	 Relative Equivalent Off
a)	 Relative Equivalent Off: “Save A Steak Dinner,” said in negative (what you 

save in relative terms) or 
b)	 “Less Than Going Out To Lunch,” said in positive (what it costs in relative 

terms)
4)	 Simply the Discounted Price

a)	 Simply Discounted Price: $29 New Client Special

Do you see how different these all look and feel? It’s the same exact promotion just 
communicated differently. By cycling through all four, you can test which resonates best in 
your audience. And if you find multiple winners, even better! It gives you more bullets in 
the chamber when a promotion fatigues. 

Before you just read to the next section, think about other ways you could use a discount 
for your own offer. Just do the exercise in your head and flex your brain muscles.

Pro Tip: Use Absolute Prices When Talking about Understood 
Products and Services

In order for the discounted price to be effective, the service will usually have 
to be one that’s well understood. People should already have an idea of what it 
costs. This is where discounts do well. If you discount something that people 
don’t understand, the offer won’t be effective. The only way around this would 
be to state the price, then state the discount (like in the absolute Amount Off 
example above). An example that would not work with this would be 50% off 
agency retainer. No one knows what the agency does or how. And agencies 
have a wide range of costs. So there would likely be a better offer that could be 
made that would be more easily understood.

Just like before, we’re gonna flip roles and have you explain the pros and cons of discounts 
to me as though we were considering them for our business. 

Pros of Discount Offers

Me: But wait, so now I know to display discount offers. But why would I choose a 
discount offer over a free offer to get more leads, if free is the most powerful?

You: There are a host of benefits that discounts get that free offers don’t provide. You 
must match the right tool for the job. Let me explain…

#1 Lots of Cheap Leads Within the Law
Me: So it’s illegal to market free stuff??
You: Of course not, but in some countries if you have any stipulations or creative 

offers around “free,” they are forbidden. Discounts allow us to advertise compliantly and 
still generate a decent amount of lead volume. This is especially true when compared to a 
premium offer, the only other alternative.

Me: Got it, so it allows me to market in ways I otherwise wouldn’t and still get good 
lead volume.

Note: If you are in a heavily regulated industry, state, or country, then a discount offer 
may be right for your business.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 29



Section A: Attract

#2 You Actually Collect Some Money
Me: So we collect money for people who buy the discount. But won’t that not amount 

to much?
You: Correct. It won’t amount to much money, but it can still help liquidate acquisition 

costs. But we will never build our business to use this money as the real way we are liquidating 
our costs. This is just the first way for us to attract and transact with a customer.

Me: Got it, so I can collect some cash up front that I wouldn’t otherwise, which is nice, 
but I shouldn’t rely on it to fund my marketing efforts.

#3 People Come in Expecting to Spend Some Sort of Money 
Me: So I guess the difference between these leads and free leads is that these folks at least 

expect to pay for something, so it won’t be a shock for them.
You: Honestly, this is more of a mental benefit than anything in my opinion. Many 

business owners/employees have crazy limiting beliefs around selling and consumer-buying 
behavior. (Not you of course). So giving them something where they feel like the prospects 
are coming in or opting in ready to spend money makes them more invested in the selling 
process. Close rates on the initial discount tend to be higher, but still the same on upselling 
the core offer to the individual, which really becomes the “second” sale. 

Me: Got it, so the discount is really for me and my team more than an actual benefit, 
and we’re still going to have to focus on the second sale which is where all the money is 
really made.

Pro Tip

This is mostly due to the conviction of the salesperson, not because people are 
inherently more willing. A good salesman will sell the same % of free vs non-
free leads (assuming the funnels and sales environment are the same). We have 
tested this four separate times in our business. I’ve tested it so many times 
because it still continues to amaze me. But—for whatever reason—it makes 
people feel better about selling, which is fine. This is especially important when 
dealing with a small business owner with limiting beliefs. Sometimes you just 
have to meet them halfway.

#4 The Two-Step Sale (Probably the Biggest Benefit)
Me: So if I’m doing some sort of discount offer, I can collect their card over the phone. 

And it’s an easy sale. But it paves the way for me making future sales more seamless and I can 
charge penalties for other things I may need them to do or adhere to during the sales process.

You: Exactly. If utilizing discount offers for lead generation, they can help eliminate 
things like “no-shows”. This is important when you have a service where the time/cost of the 
individual is real (like a doctor’s time). You want to eliminate no-shows as much as possible. 
Utilizing a discount offer over a free offer solves this problem for the most part because 
people will typically show up for things they pay for (at least 85–90% or more). For us, if we 
want to use this in our lemonade business, we can set a follow-up phone call in 7 days after 
their discounted period is over to see what they think. We can say that if they don’t show up 
to this appt, we charge them some sort of fee to make sure they show up.

We can use this strategy as a part of a two-step sales process beautifully (which in my 
opinion is probably the primary reason I would use discounts).

Me: So if I want people to do multiple things before I sell them something more 
expensive, having a discounted front end makes sure that they do it, and gives me an easy 
way to create initial trust to lead to future upsells seamlessly. I like it! 

#5 Discount Offers Make Upsells Smooth As Buttaaa 
Me: So now that I have the person’s card on file from the first transaction, I can just ask 

them, “Do you want to use the card you have on file?” for my next upsell. That’s so easy 
and seamless!

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 31



Section A: Attract

You: Yes, the whole point is we offer something valuable that’s not our core offer away 
for an insane discount with the intention of getting leads and getting a card over the phone 
to get the “thing” at a designated time. The prospect then comes in at that designated time 
and is upsold something far more expensive after receiving the initial “thing”. 

An example of a two-step sale would be us giving away a heavy metals test consultation 
for $19, then upselling the prospect into a $2,100, 10-week lemonade detox plan once we 
meet with them. So it would look like this:

Ad→ Opt in→ Phone Call for $19 Promo, Set appt→ Shows up for $19 Appt→ Gets 
Value→ Schedules follow up appt for $2,100 treatment program sale→ Shows up at second 
appt and is sold. 

You would be amazed at how many more people will buy when they don’t have to take 
their card out. It’s why Amazon’s one-click purchasing, Disney’s money wristbands, and so 
many other institutions attempt to eliminate this friction. They know they sell less. So this 
is us using that to our advantage.

Me: Got it. And it would help me get around the pesky “I forgot my card at home” 
obstacles because I would already have the card on file!

Pro Tip: It’s Easier To Upsell Than To Sell

Some people call this the “foot in the door” principle. Basically, once you get 
someone to buy something (even a small item), the likelihood they buy from you 
again goes way up. Discounts as a front end give you this benefit. It allows you to 
turn prospects into customers (an important shift). Then, you can upsell those 
customers into your main offer—with the added benefit of a “card on file” close 
and some built in trust from whatever you delivered with your discount offer.

Author Note: Add Steps As Price And Complexity Increase

The more complex the thing you sell is, or the higher the price, the more time a 
prospect will need to spend with you in order to buy. You can do this all at once 
(think weekend seminars) or over time (think multiple sales calls). Both work. If 
you’re having a conversion issue, you may simply be spending too little time with 
the prospect before asking for the sale.

Pro Tip: Give Away Lower Cost Time If You Can

The other way of solving this problem (my preference) is to not give away the 
doctor’s time. And instead operationally fix the first visit so it’s something a 
front desk admin or an assistant can handle. This would be like a prospect 
coming in for braces, filling out all the required information, taking X-ray 
pictures, applying for financing (pre-approval), and everything “else” that needs 
to be done. This allows the business to use the doctor’s time only on the most-
qualified candidates.

Typically, once the person has come in, you can set the follow up appointment 
for the “sale”. By doing it this way, you eliminate the cost of no-shows while also 
pre-qualifying all candidates and putting them in the best situation to say yes 
when they come in the next time. In person, you could also easily close a card 
for a no-show fee on the next visit. This all but ensures the person will show, 
ready to buy. 

I call this strategy the Proprietary 5 min Appointment Method (feel free to 
swipe it). If desired, the doc can squeeze the person in between appointments 
for 5min just to say hello and set up the next in-depth appointment where a 
treatment plan would be recommended and sold. This would allow them to be 
able to take appointments all the time instead of during a less than desirable 
tiny window of time for “new patients”. Increasing the available time slots for 
appointments will improve the percentage of people who schedule more than 
just about anything else.

Cons of Discount Offers

#1 Giving Away The Farm
Me: But aren’t we giving away the farm with this discount offer?
You: Well, it depends what we are discounting. If we always discount our core offer, 

then people will become trained to buy only at discounted times. No bueno. This is why we 
aren’t going to use this as our business model, just a way to acquire customers. The only time 
where true discounts on our core offer works is if our pricing model is to wildly increase 
your prices during the “regular season” and live off the discounting. Clothing retailers live 
this model. But again—it can become a double-edged sword. That’s why we’re going to

Section A: Attract

“splinter” our offer into tiny pieces and just give a core component at a discount—not the 
whole farm.

Me: Ah, got it. So we’re just giving a sliver away as value to get the card on file so we can 
upsell more later, not making it our entire business.

#2 Bargain Hoppers
Me: Won’t this attract bargain hoppers like the freebie seekers?
You: Again, this comes down to what we are giving away. This was the “issue” with 

Groupon way back in the day. People started to notice that these customers had no desire to 
buy the “main thing”. But most of the businesses that complained about this did not know 
how to structure their offers to automatically qualify prospects to become customers of their 
core service. We shouldn’t see people as customers if they buy the discount. We should see 
them as qualified leads. 

But we can resolve both of these issues with intelligent offer structure, which I will cover 
when we hit Advanced Offer Stacking in Section C.

Me: Got it. These are really just opportunities for us to upsell, and if we structure it 
right, there’s nothing unqualified at all about these folks. Heck, I buy discounts sometimes 
then want more!

Discount Offers Conclusion

In my opinion, discount offers can be used with great effectiveness on the front end 
or the back end. These can massively increase the take rate on all offers. These are wildly 
powerful. I cannot overstate this. 

In my experience, as a front-end offer, discounts tend to work better with “well 
understood” services—dentists, chiropractors, gyms, haircuts, etc. People have price ranges 
they understand so the discounts can be attractive to them to generate inquiries. It must be 
something that people would value receiving a discount from. 

If a customer doesn’t know what they are getting, a discount on it doesn’t really make 
much sense because they have nothing to compare it to. So if you’re in a well-understood 
market, or have a service that is well-understood, discount offers can be powerful on the 
front end. 

The other main benefit is that discounts almost entirely eliminate no-shows.

Discount Promotions

Attract Section Conclusion: Brass Tacks

If you are not getting enough response, you probably need to make your front end 
more appealing. We need to give people who otherwise wouldn’t respond a reason to do so. 
Enhancing your Grand Slam Offer with a free or discount front end is the fastest way to do 
that. This applies whether you are just figuring out your first acquisition channel or whether 
you are adding an additional acquisition. Always remember—Generate Flow→ Monetize 
Flow→ Increase Friction. In that order. As I said in the beginning, I almost always start with 
a free or massively discounted offer so that I have something to benchmark and improve 
upon. 

Fundamentally, to make this process work you must know your business and your 
product better than your customers do. Why? Because all businesses capitalize on an 
information advantage. As in, we know more about our customers’ problems than they do. 
We capitalize on this advantage by making them aware of all the other problems they are 
going to encounter on their journey, then capitalizing on that through upsells. This is how 
you design a winning acquisition strategy.

SECTION B: THE EXPENSIVE 
CUSTOMER PROBLEM

If you can spend more than your competition to get a customer, 
you will get more customers than them.

Lost Chapter Author Note**: The next chapters were in the final draft of 
$100M Money Models and I cut them last minute because I thought they were 

too conceptual. I wanted to focus the book purely on tactics. But, otherwise, I 
love these chapters. They’ll help you understand the core problem most businesses 

face in acquiring customers and the math to describe the problem.

Pay extra attention to this section. You may have to go over it more than once. That’s 
okay. Learning isn’t about who reads the fastest or takes the best notes. It’s about who does the 
stuff. Big money comes from this small section. Keep coming back here until you can do the 
stuff. It will pay off. I promise.  

Customer Financed Acquisition

Customers cost money. If you make that money back faster, you can get customers 
faster. The faster you make double that amount, the faster you can turn one customer into 
two more. Two into four. Four into eight, and so on. If customers pay you fast enough, you 
eliminate cash as the bottleneck to growth. 

A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. And getting customers to spend 
more money faster is crucial for scaling any bootstrapped business. The only reasonable 
alternatives are loans and investors. These are great moves when you do them at the right 
time. But doing it too early will probably bite you in the butt later. For that reason, I prefer 
Customer Financed Acquisition. In other words, I like to be profitable “day one” and stay 
profitable—on my own—forever. That way if I take out loans or get investors, I do it on my 
terms. Here’s how I do it. 

Customer Financed Acquisition (CFA) is when 30 days of GP (gross profit) from a 
customer is greater than the CAC—the Cost of Acquiring the Customer. In plain English, it 
solves your cash flow problems. I express CFA like this: 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 37



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

30 Day Gross Profit > CAC 

It costs money to get customers. You wanna make the money you spent to get that 
customer back as profit in the first thirty days. That way you can use that money again to get 
another customer. Recycling money is awesome. 

30 Day GP > 2x CAC

But what if we could do one better? What if every customer injects enough cash in the 
first 30 days to pay for two new customers? 

And 2x is my “real life” minimum standard. In practice, I want customers to more than 
just pay for themselves. I want a 2x or more. If you do it that way, you only have to buy your 
first customer. Then, that customer pays for every other customer and you can grow the 
business as fast as it can handle. That’s the game of CFA. And that’s what I’m going to show 
you how to do for yourself.

You pull three levers to make CFA work…

T﻿he Three Levers of CFA

“So you’re telling me, we can get paid to make money? Sign me up.” – Young me to older me

Lost Chapter Author Note**: Same thing here. Too many math questions from sample 
readers. And everyone gets scared with math, so I ended up cutting it. But I love this chapter.

To Grow A Business

You can either: Get more customers OR Make them worth more. To grow our business, 
we do both. 

But there’s one more variable I care about—speed. In other words, I don’t just care that a 
business grows, I care how fast it grows. And if we’re smart, we can have it all. We get more 
customers, make them worth more, and do it fast. And those three elements create the three 
levers of CFA:

1)	 Get More Customers→Lower The Cost of Acquiring Customers (↓CAC)
2)	 Make Them Worth More→Increase Lifetime Gross Profit (↑LTGP)
3)	 Do It Fast→Decrease Payback Period (↓PPD)

CFA Lever #1: Get More Customers→Lower The Cost of Acquiring 
Customers

To get more customers, you need to spend more on advertising or lower how much it 
Costs to Acquire a Customer (CAC). And the lower it is, the better. You find it by adding 
money spent on advertising, sales, and their supporting activities divided by the number of 
customers you get. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 39



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

Example: You pay a content producer $10,000 per month. Each month you 
acquire 10 new customers from the content they make.  
 CAC = $10,000 costs/10 customers acquired = $1,000

But how much money you can spend to acquire customers depends on how much each 
customer is worth. The more a customer is worth, the more customers you can get. So…

CFA Lever #2: Make Them Worth More→Increase Lifetime Gross Profit

So to get more customers, we spend more money on advertising. But to spend more 
money on advertising, we need to make more money from the customers we have.

Gross Profit (GP): This is how much you make from a customer after factoring in the 
cost of giving them the thing they bought. You find it by subtracting the price customers 
pay for your thing minus the cost of fulfillment. The higher it is, the better. 

Product Example: I sell a widget for $100. It costs me $20 to make and ship the 
widget to the customer. 
GP = $100 Price - $20 Costs = $80 
Service Example: You sell 10 service packages at $1,000 each. You pay one 
employee $2,000 to service those 10 packages. 
Total GP  = $10,000 sold - $2,000 costs = $8,000 
GP Per Customer = $8,000/ 10 Customers = $800

If we make more money from each customer, we can spend more to get them. So, we 
want to make as much money as we can (as fast as we can). 

40 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



The Three Levers of CFA

CFA Lever #3: Do It Fast→Decrease Payback Period

Lowering CAC and raising GP doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It happens in time. If a 
customer pays for themselves today, you can get another one tomorrow. If a customer takes 
thirty days to pay for themselves, you can get another one in thirty days. Which would you 
prefer? The first one. Main reason: you can grow thirty times faster. In the real world, speed 
matters. The technical term for this is Payback Period. In other words, how long it takes for 
your gross profit from a customer to exceed the cost you spent to acquire them. Math wise, it’s 
when GP>CAC.

Bottom Line: The rest of this section shows you how to make GP as high as possible 
and CAC as low as possible…as fast as possible (short PPD). The lower your CAC, the faster 
you break even. The higher your GP, the faster you can break even, get cash flow, and grow. 
And, we do both—fast.

Know The Levers

Lost Chapter Author Note**: Next three chapters are very in-depth math examples. 
I actually wrote them as part of an internal document that made it into 

$100M Money Models then eventually got removed. But, money math is the language of 
business. This deeper understanding will take you to the next level if you want to go there.

The three levers of acquisition are: Cost to Acquire a Customer (CAC), Lifetime Gross 
Profit (LTGP), and Payback Period (PPD). Knowing how to calculate and improve them is 
how you accomplish Customer Financed Acquisition. We’ll dive into each in more depth 
below. As stated above, this is more advanced so I ended up cutting it. But if you enjoy this 
stuff…you’ll probably make a lot of money.

Cost To Acquire a Customer = CAC

How much does it cost you to make money?

Every business owner always wants new low-cost ways to get new customers. Because 
the lower your cost to get a customer, the better your ratio is between what you spend and 
what you make. If you spend $10 to make $1,000 it seems a helluva lot cooler than $900 to 
make $1,000. This is how crazy wealth gets made. 

Here’s the problem: most entrepreneurs have never calculated their actual CAC. They 
report on how much ad spend it costs them to get a customer. Or they think that their 
content leads are “free”. Or, their outbound team they don’t consider, only the commissions 
etc. Then, they’re surprised at the end of the month when they’re not making any money. 
That $1,000 sale you thought cost you $200 to make, really costs $500. And as small 
of a difference as that may seem, in some businesses that can be the difference between 
$1,000,000 per month and $10,000,000 per month. It’s that important. 

So let’s talk about how to know it for sure. Unlike LTGP, CAC is a hard science. You 
can and should know exactly what it costs you to get a customer each month, by channel. 
If you don’t, and you were looking for a sign to start tracking…here’s your sign. So let’s do 
three examples.

Cost of Acquiring a Customer (CAC): The cost to get a new customer: advertising dollars, 
payroll to a media buyer, creative team, software, sales commissions and salaries, etc.

a)	 Outreach Example: You use $200 per month email software. You pay 
someone $3,000 per month to cold email prospects for you. Emails become 
appointments that turn into eight sales per month. You pay your salesperson 
$100 per sale. 
What’s CAC? 

Total cost for eight sales =
$3,000 Emailer + $200 Software + $800 Commissions (8 x $100) = $4,000
Now divide that by the number of new customers = 
Cost to Acquire a Customer (CAC) = $4,000 Cost / 8 New Customers = 
$500

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 45



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

b)	 Content Marketing Example: You have two people on your media team that 
you pay $5,000 per month each. They help you make, edit, and distribute 
content across all platforms. That content turns into inbound messages and 
options on your site. Those leads turn into ten new customers. You pay $100 
commission per sale. What’s CAC?

Total cost for ten new customers = 
Media Payroll: ($5,000 x 2) = $10,000 
Commissions: 10 Sales x $100 = $1,000 
$10,000 + $1,000 = $11,000
Cost to Acquire a Customer (CAC) = $11,000 / 10 customers = $1,100

c)	 Paid Ads Example: You pay a media buyer $4,000 per month. You spend 
$20,000 in media (buying ads). You spend $1,000 in commissions per sale. 
You spend $1,000 in software for tracking and following up with leads that 
come in. You get ten new customers. What’s CAC?

Total cost for ten new customers = 
Media Payroll: $4,000
Media Spend: $20,000
Software Costs = $1,000 
Commissions: 10 Sales x $1,000 = $10,000
$4,000 + $20,000 + $1,000 + $10,000 = $35,000
Cost to Acquire a Customer (CAC) = $35,000 cost / 10 customers = 
$3,500

CAC Action Step: calculate your CAC for your business for the past few months. And 
if you advertise in multiple ways or on multiple platforms, figure out how much it costs you 
on each. The results may surprise you. Hint: One of the first things we do when we invest 
in a company is run a full diagnostic on acquisition. Half the time we find a channel or 
platform that’s doing significantly better than others. Guess what we do next…we do more 
of the one that gets us the best-cost customers.

Cost To Acquire a Customer = CAC

Now we understand what CAC is, and how to calculate it independent of advertising 
method. Hooray. Next up, if we can’t lower CAC anymore then our next big lever is to 
increase how much we can pay compared to our competition. Which—we can do by 
increasing our lifetime gross profit per customer (LGTP)...

Lifetime Gross Profit (LTGP)
The arms race of business.

LTGP: The amount of gross profit a business collects over the lifespan of a customer. In other 
words, how much total money you make from a customer minus everything it costs you to 
deliver it. 

Now, that’s easy to understand, but can be hard to figure out if you don’t have a customer 
relationship management (CRM) system or tool that tracks some of these metrics. That’s 
okay though. I’m going to give you some “back of napkin” ways to calculate it. 

LTGP Step One: Gross Profit

The first thing you have to figure out is your gross profit. Gross Profit is what’s leftover 
from a purchase after you deliver the goods or service. Note: this isn’t net profit (which is what’s 
left over at the end of the month after you paid all expenses). This is just what’s leftover on 
the core thing you sell. You then run your business on this gross profit to pay the rest of your 
bills (and hopefully have some left over for your pocket at the end of the month).

Author Note: Many entrepreneurs mix up Gross Profit and 
Net Profit

Gross Profit is money left over after only subtracting the costs of making and 
delivering your product or service.

Net Profit is money left over after subtracting all costs.

Product Example: I sell a widget for $100. It costs me $20 to manufacture and ship the 
widget to the end customer. My gross profit is $100 - $20 = $80. 

Also, Gross Margin is your gross profit expressed as a percentage of the total price you 
charge. Gross margin and gross profit get used in a lot of similar situations. Don’t let it 
confuse you. It’s the same concept. Gross profit is expressed in an absolute dollar amount 
while gross margin is the same concept expressed as a percentage. In this example, my gross 
profit is $80 but my gross margin is 80% ($80/$100 = 80%). That was a good warm-up, 
let’s do one for services. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 49



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

Service Example #1: I deliver services monthly. I have one account representative per 10 
clients. My clients pay $3,000 per month each. My reps cost me $6,000 per month. Let’s 
figure out the gross profit/gross margin.

Clients Per Rep = 10
Revenue Per Client = $3,000
Cost Per Rep = $6,000
So, I make 10 clients/rep x $3,000/mo = $30,000/mo per representative. Assuming I 

have no other costs for delivering my service, my gross profit is $30,000 Revenue - $6,000 
Cost  = $24,000. My gross margin is $24,000/$30,000 = 80%. So my gross profit on a 
single customer is $3,000 x 80% = $2,400. Cool right?

LTGP Step One Action→Figure out your gross profit and gross margin for each thing 
you sell and your business overall. Hint: you may be surprised that some products you spend 
a lot of time on don’t make you as much profit as you thought.  

LTGP Step Two: Figure the average number of transactions a customer makes over their 
lifetime. 

If your CRM tells you this—awesome. But oftentimes, they don’t. And even if they do, 
they’re often wrong because data tracking can be a mess (especially if you’re starting out). 
So it’s good to understand how to do this money math. I’m gonna give you a few “back of 
napkin” methods that you use depending on your circumstances. 

Disclaimer: Figuring out how many transactions a customer makes on average is always 
an estimate because everyday customers buy more stuff and the business gets older. As such, 
lifetime transactions always increase as a business gets older because old customers buy more. 
So these are the ways I estimate it. 

1)	 Export your lifetime customer data. Sort by number of transactions. Average out 
that column. Ta-da. 

a)	 Ex: Avg # of transactions = 4
2)	 If you have a recurring revenue business, you figure it out differently. This forces us 

to introduce a new concept—churn. Churn is the percentage of customers that leave 
between time periods. So, if on the first of last month we had 100 customers and this 
month, of those 100 customers, we lost five, our churn is 5%. 

a)	 Last Period = 100

50 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Lifetime Gross Profit (LTGP)

b)	 This period = 95
c)	 Difference = 100-95= 5
d)	 Churn = people who left divided by original amount = 5 / 100 = 5%

Note: People get this twisted. Don’t be one. If you sign up new clients during this time 
period, it does not affect churn. The same number of original people left. You could sign 
up zero or 1,000 new clients during the same month. You still lost five of the original one 
hundred and your churn is still 5%. 

LTGP Step Two Action: Figure out # of transactions or churn. Now that we have this 
figured out, all we have to do is put steps one and two together to get our lifetime gross profit. 

LTGP Step Three: If you have a physical products business, multiply average gross 
profit by # of transactions. Or, if you have a recurring business, divide gross profit by churn 
percentage. 

Physical Products LTGP Example: 
Gross profit x average transactions per customer = LTGP
$80 x 4 = $360 LTGP
That’s it!

Services LTGP Example:
Gross profit / Churn = LTGP
$2,400 / 5%  = $48,000
Bingo. See. Math - no fun. Money math - so fun. 

That being said, I want to make an important point. LTGP is the arms race of business. 
In an auction of attention, the person that can spend the most to acquire a customer wins (Dan 
Kennedy). Or as I prefer to say it—the business that makes its customer the most valuable, 
wins. After all, you can only get CAC to zero, but LTGP can go infinitely high. And in my 
experience, it’s easier to make advertising more efficient than it is to make people stay longer. 
CAC is about getting customers. LTGP is about keeping customers.

This leads us to the final part of our acquisition trio: Payback Period (PPD). 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 51



52 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Payback Period = PPD

How fast do you make your money back?

If you think of what a business is, it’s a box where you get a much higher return than 
the stock market, on far less money. What makes businesses valuable is they are able to get 
5x, 10x, 20x returns, in a matter of weeks or months, compared to 10% returns over years. 

Payback Period: the time it takes to break even on what you spent to get a new customer. 
Example: You make $50 per month in gross profit from a new customer. You pay 

$100 to acquire that customer. You get your first payment day 1, so you get $50 of your 
original $100 back. Then you get your second payment on day 31, to get the remaining 
$50 of your $100 back. Therefore, your payback period is 31 days. 

I’ll be using a hypothetical business (a lemonade stand) throughout this section to 
illustrate the concepts and frameworks, and to make acquisition models fun and accessible. 
Most importantly, I’m doing this to illustrate that these models work with all businesses 
including yours, whatever it might be.

Let’s Start a Lemonade Stand

Alright. Here we are. We’ve got a fledgling lemonade business. We’ve got aspirations to 
become Citrus Kings of a lemon empire. But do we have the skills yet to do it?

Let’s say we start with a recurring lemonade model. And let’s say for simplicity’s sake 
that we charge $10 per month per customer. And let’s say our average customer stays five 
months, for a total of $50 of lifetime revenue. (Note: add or remove zeroes as desired, this 
could also be $10,000 per month and $50,000 lifetime revenue, depending on the product, 
business, or prices you aspire to—the concepts remain the same).

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 53



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

Now let’s say we run 80% gross profit margins. In this hypothetical business, we might 
pay $2 per month to fulfill these $10 per month lemonade shipments for us (delivery costs, 
lemonade powder, filtered water, etc.). So $10 - $2 = $8 gross profit. That’s an 80% gross 
margin. That means of the $50 we make, $40 of that is gross profit—aka, it goes towards 
paying our other costs (like paying off the corner neighbor to use their lawn, keeping track 
of our accounting) and making a profit for us (the owners). In this example, as the average 
customer buys lemonade for five months, our LTGP is $250. Knowing only how much we 
make (LTGP), it would be impossible to know if our lemonade business is likely to be a 
rocket ship or a dud. We also need to consider CAC and then PPD to help us fully figure 
out our growth potential. 

54 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Payback Period = PPD

How much is the CAC for a customer that pays us $10 per month? That’s the next 
piece of information we need. This includes all the costs that go into acquiring a customer: 
advertising dollars, payroll to a media buyer, creative team, software that team uses to make 
advertising, sales commissions and salaries, etc. (If you like pictures, I did my best to illustrate 
this above). 

The back of napkin math way I use to figure this out is by looking back at any time 
period in the past (last 3, 6, 9, or 12 months):

Equation:
(All Marketing & Sales Team Compensation, Advertising, Software) / CAC 

 = Total # of Customers Acquired over a Period of Time

Example:
 $400,000 Total Costs to Acquire all Customers For 12 Months / $40 CAC 

= 10,000 Customers Acquired in the business for 12 months

So, how quickly does the lemonade stand pay the CAC back and start making money? 
Aka - payback period. Payback period is important because it will increase the speed of the 
cycles in which you can multiply your cash. Doubling our money in one month versus 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 55



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

three months may not seem like “that big” of a difference. But it is. We’re talking about a 4x 
difference in growth potential. We could double our money in a month (2x), then double 
our doubled amount in month two (4x), and finally double our quadrupled amount in 
month three (8x), for a total of 8x our original sum. The three-month example would only 
double in that same three-month period. So the first business would grow at 4x the speed 
((8x/2x = 4x), compounded quarterly. That is why the payback period is so important.

Alex’s Most Prized Metric: 30 Day Cash (30D Cash)

Getting you to understand Customer Financed Acquisition is literally the objective of 
this section. What it is. How to achieve it. How to scale it. 

A key factor in this process is time. If you had unlimited time to pay a debt back, your 
likelihood of repayment (assuming ethical behavior) approaches 100%. The shorter the 
window, the less likely. Mastering the timeline of cash flow unlocks truly limitless growth. 
It got me from $1,036 in my bank account to $100M+ in sales in a few short years...using 
other people’s money to fuel the growth. With that, what is 30 Day Cash? 

30D Cash is the amount of gross profit I can extract from a new customer in their first 30 
days. 

The reason 30 days is so critical for small businesses is that 30 days is typically the 
amount of time any business can get interest-free financing—credit cards being a prime 
example. If I can increase my 30D Cash above my CAC, then it means that I can get free 
customers using other people’s money. 

In other words, I max out a credit card with 0 interest to acquire new customers. And 
by the time my first payment is due (30 days), I pay off the entire balance interest free from 
the gross profit my new customers have brought me. At the end of the month I now have 
a 0 debt on my card, which I can max out again next month, new customers (that paid for 
themselves), and hopefully some profit for myself. This is how you get free customers for life 
(and get paid doing it). 

Let’s look at the picture below. I can’t play a video in a book, so follow the circled numbers 
in sequence to understand each of the five points. I’ll dive into each below the image.

56 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Payback Period = PPD

 

1)	 Day 0: We borrow $40 to acquire our first customer
2)	 Between day 1–30: We make $50 in revenue. Our cost to fulfill is $10. So $40 

gross profit remains.
3)	 Day 30: We repay our original $40 debt with the $40 gross profit so our balance 

is $0. So after 30 days we have 0 debt and a new customer that will continue to 
spit off more gross profit every month. Then we re-borrow $40 again to acquire 
another customer.

4)	 Between day 30–60: We make an additional $40 gross profit from our first 
customer, which we then pocket for ourselves.

5)	 Day 60: Our second customer spits off another $40 in gross profit, which we 
use to repay our debt once more returning our balance to $0. After this is all said 
and done, we have two customers paying us $80 gross profit per month and zero 
debt. 

Using this process, we can finance each customer using other customers’ money (or as 
some people call it “other people’s money”—aka OPM). The only money we need to get 
started is the first cost of acquisition.

Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

Author Note

This process is intended for businesses to get financing from their clients rather 
than outside investors. If you apply the concepts, you will have no need for 
outside capital. There’s always a clever way to get your customers to pay for 
your growth. You just have to look for it. If you already have capital, you can use 
these strategies to better allocate that money towards your product and your 
team rather than acquiring customers. 

Understanding these three metrics: 1) LTGP (Lifetime Gross Profit), 2) CAC (Cost of 
Acquiring a Customer), and 3) Payback Period, are the key to understanding how to unlock 
acquisition. It is the basis upon which we will layer Customer Financed Acquisition: the 
holy grail of customer acquisition.

Example of the Problem: Normal Lemonade Business

Let’s say we learn how to market on a channel (door knocking, email, advertising, cold 
calling, etc). On this channel, we acquire customers for $20 and our payback period is two 
months. Customers from this channel will make us $40 in LTGP. Great. Now we have our 
three variables. Let’s look at what running our business day-to-day would look like from a 
cash flow perspective.

We have no customers. So, we put our pennies together to spend $20 on marketing. 
After spending that $20, we get one customer who pays us $10 per month. It costs us $2 
per month to pay an employee to fulfill these products. So we make $8 back from our $20 
spent in our first month. In our second month we make another $8 back. And in our third 
month, we would make $8 again, putting us $4 over our $20 cost of acquiring the customer. 
Then the customer stays for two more months. We make $8 each month, totaling $20 of 
gross profit. Hooray—we doubled our $20 investment in five months! Not so fast. Here’s 
how it breaks down visually…

Day 0 (-$20): We spend $20 on marketing.
Day 30 (-$12): We make $10, $8 in gross profit, but it goes towards recouping CAC.
Day 60 (-$4): We make another $10, $8 in gross profit, still going towards CAC.
Day 90 ($4): We make $10, $8 in gross profit. We are finally making money! +$4.

Payback Period = PPD

Day 120 ($12): We make $10, $8+ in gross profit.
Day 150 ($20): We make $10, $8+ in gross profit, then the client cancels (sad face).

The business still needs to pay fixed costs like rent, utilities, software expenses, etc. It 
also needs to, you know, actually pay us as the owners (the point). Based on the above 
numbers, we’re looking at a hard business to grow! But it is very, very common. Notice we 
don’t see our cash returned to us until month three (while still maintaining and running the 
business!). 

Author Note

How much you make (LTGP), how fast you make it (Payback Period), and what it 
costs to make it (CAC) all factor into your ability to create a wonderful business. 

Example of The Solution: Wonderful Lemonade Business

Now let’s say you, being the smart entrepreneur you are, come to me and say, “There has 
to be a better way.” 

I agree. 
Then you go read the $100M Series. Then you read it again. 
That quickly, you’ve become a master of acquisition. You figure out a way to acquire 

customers for less money and get paid back faster. Given your newfound skill, let’s imagine 
our cost to acquire a customer is now $1 (CAC = $1) and we’re able to pay back that $1 in 
seven days (payback period = 7 days).

With this new model, we put our money together and spend $1 on marketing with a 
new channel and method. For purposes of keeping our lives simple, we decided to keep our 
prices and margins the same. We would make the same $8 gross profit back that first week 
and $8 per month of profit the next four months, totaling $40. 

Here’s where it gets wild. Since our CAC is so low and our Payback Period is so fast, we 
could pay back our original $1 CAC almost immediately. Then we could reuse the $7 gross 
profit left from the first transaction to go get ourselves seven more customers. And from those 
seven, seven more customers, and so forth. This would be a wonderful business to grow! It’s 
hard to envision with words, so let’s break it out visually. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 59



Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

Day 0 (-$1): We spend $1 on marketing.
Day 7 ($7):  We acquire a customer who pays $10. We make $8 of gross profit. We cover 

CAC of $1 and still have $7 left over.
Day 8 ($0): We spend the $7 in gross profit we just made on more marketing. Now we’re 

back to $0 (but that’s okay!).
Day 14 ($56): We acquire seven more customers at $1 each. Each pays $10 for a total of 

$70. We make $8 in gross profit each, so 7 x $8 = +$56. Woohoo!
Day 15 ($49): We now have enough money to get ourselves 49 new customers. But we 

decide we can’t possibly handle that many more customers. So we just stick with 
acquiring another seven. So we spend $7 on marketing in the hopes of getting 
seven more customers. $56 - $7 = $49.

Day 22 ($105): Success! We get seven more customers from our $7 of marketing, which 
makes us another 7 x $8 gross profit, and another $56 in gross profit. This is 
starting to get crazy!

Day 30 ($105): We take a breather.
Day 37 ($113): We keep breathing but realize that first customer renewal comes up and 

makes us another $8 of gross profit. We didn’t have to spend anything for this. 
Sweet!

Day 44 ($169): The next seven customers renew with $8 of gross profit each +$56. Holy 
cow.

Day 51 ($225): A week later the next seven renew and generate yet another +$56. Man, 
printing money is fun!

Day 60 . . . we decide to write a book on acquisition (joking). 

The example above is gross profit, not revenue. So this is money in the bank after paying 
all the cost of fulfilling the customer and the cost of acquisition. The only place this money 
goes is to pay fixed costs (rent, software, etc) and to pay us (the point!). Or the money could 
go to grow our team, so this month we can handle 14 clients per week instead of seven. This 
is how businesses grow without taking outside capital.

So, how much money did we actually spend in marketing during our wonderful 
lemonade scenario?

Drum roll . . . 

60 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Payback Period = PPD

Answer: $1. 
Wait, what? Yep. We only took that first $1 out of pocket and spent it on advertising. 

The rest of the time, we are playing with the “found” money. It’s like gambling at the casino 
with $1, making $8, paying yourself back the original $1 bet, then playing the rest of the 
time with the $7 winnings. Another way of saying it is: we crowdfunded the growth of our 
business using our customers and a clever acquisition system. 

I’ve been playing with the house’s money for almost a decade now, and by the end of this 
book, you can too.

Levels of Customer Financed Acquisition

New levels, new devils.

By connecting GP and speed with CAC, I see three levels of CFA.
CFA Level 1: You make less profit (GP) from a customer than it costs you to get one (CAC) in 

the first thirty days. You eventually come out ahead, it just takes longer. This means floating 
your businesses on life savings, loans, and lines of credit. A big risk. And speaking from lots 
of experience… it sucks.

And yes, you can absolutely make money this way over the long term. And many big 
businesses make all their money this way. But you have to already have lots of money to do it. 
And most young bootstrapped businesses don’t. So I avoid this when starting out. 

CFA Level 2: You make the same profit from a customer as it costs you to get one in the first 
thirty days. I specify 30 days because any business can get interest-free money for 30 days 
in the form of a credit card. If you clear your balance before the end of the month, it works 
just like normal money. So you can use credit to get a customer, pay it back, and then use it 
again to get the next customer.

At level 2, since you pay off the card each month, your credit limit becomes your 
advertising budget. This means it caps how many customers you can get. So if you have a 
$5,000 limit, you can only get the number of customers $5,000 will get. Of course, you can 
expand your budget by paying your balance off early, asking for a higher limit, or getting 
another card. Easy peasy.  

The contents from the rest of this section will boost your GP and get you to level 3.
CFA Level 3: You make more than double the profit from a customer than it costs you to 

get one in the first thirty days. This holds a special place in my heart. It’s how I’ve scaled all 
my businesses. In principle, it means you can double your business every month (or faster). 
Think about it this way: You pay the balance of your original spend. Then, between the 
credit and extra cash, you can get two more customers. And if you only use the extra cash, 
you can ditch credit altogether when the GP rolls in. 

From that point on—–all customers pay for themselves. And you can use your extra cash 
for whatever you want…including getting even more customers. CFA removes “cash” from 
your list of problems in life.

Section B: The Expensive Customer Problem

As a reminder: Making twice what it costs me to get a customer in profit is my minimum. 
My first year of Gym Launch we got $100 back in profit for every $1 we spent. Yes. 100x. 
Spending $100,000 to make $10M in returns. We obviously scaled as much as we could 
from that. But then operations limited us...not getting customers. And that’s the goal here. 

If you wonder: why bother getting more customers when I could just pay myself? I say, why 
do one, when you could do both? Once customers start paying for themselves, I can grow 
my business and pay myself. Best part is, when you do it this way, your business grows every 
month and so does your paycheck. 

CFA: Playing It Out

You must pass CFA level one to stay in business for the long haul. With a decent product 
and a good offer, you can bootstrap your growth to level two. Then, you master Money 
Models—see $100M Money Models—to unlock profitable hyperscaling at level three. And 
once you hit level three, cash to get customers no longer constrains your business. 

To show you how powerful this is, let’s play out CFA Level 3 for your new business. And 
let’s assume you put all extra profits into getting more customers. Over the next 12 months, 
you would go from one lonely customer to… an army of 4,095 customers. Best of all, you’d 
only have to pay for the first customer. The rest of the growth—your customers pay for. That’s 
why it’s called Customer Financed Acquisition. They finance the acquisition of your new 
customers! The table below lays it all out.

Months at CFA Level 3 New Customers Acquired Total Customers Acquired
1 1 1
2 2 3
3 4 7
4 8 15
5 16 31
6 32 63
7 64 127
8 128 256
9 256 511
10 512 1023
11 1024 2047
12 2048 4095

And that’s only with a GP at twice CAC! It can go much higher. And yes, something else 
will eventually bottleneck your growth. And that’s OK. That’s life. But you never want that 
bottleneck to be cash for getting customers. 

64 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Levels of Customer Financed Acquisition

And that’s really what CFA is all about. Removing cash, and by extension 
“customer-getting” as your limit for growth. If I can do that for you, and help you achieve 
your vision, we’ve won.

Solution Explained

When you do this right, you don’t need to have a lot of money to make a lot of money. 
The clients themselves are like pre-loaded bags of money who pay for themselves and the 
next customer. 

This is how we achieve forced viral growth. This is how my software company went from 
$60,000 per month in revenue to $1.7M per month in revenue in six months. It’s how my 
consulting business went from $215,000 per month to $1.8M per month in eight months. 
And it’s how my e-commerce business went from $80,000 per month to $1.5M per month 
in six months. This. Stuff. Works. 

Now from this example you could very quickly see that the bottleneck would not be 
the ability to acquire customers, but to service them. I’m not going to get into how to scale 
a company in this book. The objective of this book is to get you to the point where scaling, 
rather than acquiring customers, becomes your problem. It may seem crazy to you, but this 
is how you become unbeatable. So change your beliefs, and you’ll change your business and 
your life. 

The “Normal Business” example is what most businesses deal with on a regular basis. 
This is why the median small business owner makes $72,489 per year (Source: Payscale). 
There’s nothing wrong with that, but given the massive personal risk and investment we take 
on as business owners, it would probably be easier to drive Uber and make $70,000 per year 
with no risk, no investment, and complete schedule flexibility. We business owners take the 
risks and work our asses off because we believe in the promise of more, and that’s why I’m 
hoping you’re reading this book: the promise of more. 

Acquisition masters, in stark contrast, print money. It’s the type of business and 
acquisition process we want to build. And the beautiful part about building an acquisition 
model like this is that anyone can do it with skill. 

At the end of the day, I believe that having a great business is a choice. Many do not 
believe they can have a great business. They expect 2:1 returns on advertising to be “good 
enough,” when, in truth, with just a few tweaks they could never spend another dollar on 
advertising again and let their customers pay for the growth of their business. That’s what 
we’re here to accomplish.

SECTION C: 
ADVANCED OFFER STACKING

“In your heart, you know… that the juice is worth the squeeze.” 
‒ Matthew Kidman, The Girl Next Door

Lost Chapter Author Note**: This next section starts off with a different way of visualizing 
maximizing lifetime gross profit per customer. I find it to be a more mathematical way 
of figuring out what to sell and when. After this primer, the remainder of the chapters 

are a hodgepodge of attraction offers, upsell offers, and continuity offers that didn’t make 
it into $100M Money Models. They were typically either too hard, or too niched. In 
either case, I didn’t think they applied to a wide enough array of businesses. That being 

said, for the right businesses, they might change everything for you. Think of these as 
more bullets to add to your potential $100M Money Model. Feel free to skip around 

the chapters and read the descriptions to find the ones that might work for you.

In this section of the book, we’ll look at what I believe to be the best piece of my 
winning strategy. Understanding and executing this concept of stacking offers has made 
me generational wealth. Ironically, I don’t think it’s difficult. I just think most people don’t 
know the concept even exists. I promised you at the beginning of the book that the deeper 
into the book you got, the juicier the nuggets would be.

This is exactly what I was talking about. The earlier materials are no less important. 
They’re just foundational. Just as we need to learn how to draw before we can paint. A basic 
skill begets a more advanced and valuable skill. Understanding offer stacking will allow you 
to compete in any marketplace, on any traffic platform. It can even be used to starve your 
competitors. I try to be a good-hearted individual, but I play to win, as should you. The next 
few chapters are your new winning strategy. 

Basic Outline of the Section

The back end informs the front end. That means the more money you make per 
customer, the more you can spend to acquire customers. Making a Grand Slam Offer is 
both about lowering the cost of acquisition and making more per customer. In this section, 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 67



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

I will show you how to layer or “stack” Grand Slam Offers on top of one another to create 
higher lifetime value, aka “the back end”. So this is making a series of Grand Slam Offers in 
a row in order to increase how much a client is worth to the business. This is where things 
get wild. 

68 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Back End: The Value Grid
The business owner who makes his customer more valuable to 

his business, than to that of his competition, wins. 
- (My rephrasing of Dan Kennedy’s quote, “He who can 

spend the most to acquire a customer wins”)

Lost Chapter Author Note**: This chapter felt too conceptual. I like it a lot. It’s how I 
actually think about increasing LTV—which is so important for getting customers. But, alas, 

I didn’t think people needed to understand it, so I cut it from the $100M Offers book.

Winter 2019.
“Wait, so you sell twice as many people as I do every month, but you make 56x more 

profit than me?”
“Yeah, it seems like it.”
“Holy cow. So I just need to focus on making more per customer. I don’t need to get 

more clients at all.”
“Correct.”
This exchange happened on a $50,000 consulting day that I had with someone in my 

space. 
They were on pace for about $3M/year in their business. It was profitable, and they were 

making money. But they were having trouble scaling. When they came out to my office, 
they expected the conversation was going to be about marketing and sales. But after quickly 
reviewing their numbers, I saw they were doing fine on that front. The issue was…they just 
didn’t make enough per customer. They had one offer that wasn’t irresistible, and had no 
upsell or continuity. So it cost them about 50% more to acquire customers than it cost me. 
On top of that, I made 10 times more than they did on that same customer. Literally. And 
how we did it is the process I am going to share with you right now.

LTGP is the arms race of business. The higher you can make that number, the more 
untouchable you become. The higher that number is, the more damage you can inflict 
on your competition. You can eventually starve them out of the marketplace. This is why 
becoming a world-class marketer is so important. You can make a product as good as you 
want, but if you can’t outspend your competition, your competition will steal your product 
and your potential customers.  

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 69



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Let me give you an example. If you can pay 10x more to acquire a customer than your 
competition can, you can decide to increase your spending budget such that you compete 
against yourself until you raise the bar so that no one can buy ads in your niche.

What this means: if you can claim the throne, you can make yourself virtually unbeatable. 
You can suck up the entire marketplace and make it very difficult for new people to enter. 
This is similar to a monopoly, except it’s legal. 

It’s the opposite of predatory pricing (where people lower their prices to force people to 
operate unprofitably) as well. We’re actually taking the opposite strategy of providing more 
value and raising our prices to make so much money that we can afford to be less efficient. 
As you do this, you continue to increase your market share, increase how much you make, 
and add more upsells to increase your lifetime value. When someone new comes in, they 
would either need to have capital to burn trying to catch up with you, or an entirely new 
way to monetize their customers to beat you. 

I’m not going to get into the many, many, many ways to increase lifetime value. That 
will be the subject of a future book that I haven’t written yet. What I am going to do is 
simply focus on one of the simplest ways to multiply your lifetime value—“stacking” offers.

Many people think of increasing a customer’s lifetime value in sequence or stair steps. A 
customer comes in at the bottom or halfway, then ascends up. I think this is a very good 
way of getting people to think about their business in terms of how to increase the value you 
provide. 

Although it’s a useful visual aid, a sequence or stair step fails to take into account a key 
point…not all customers follow it. So, I think of it more as a grid. For two primary reasons: 
first, with a stair step, the visual depiction makes your brain think that all customers must 
buy the first in order to buy the second. It depicts the relationship as linear. This has not 
been my experience. I think the stair-step visual model falls short in that regard (all models 
have limits) but is a great place to start to get ideas down. But once you have metrics, the 
grid becomes an invaluable tool. Here’s why… 

Many times people buy offer #1 then skip to offer #4. Or they skip offers #1 and #2 and 
buy offers #3 and #5. Or something like that. They don’t buy linearly; they buy the ones 
they want to buy or that solve their needs. The value ladder is based on a fractal concept 
of customers. At each level only a small percentage of them will take the offer with the big 
jump in price. But it doesn’t take into account multiple offers at the same price point solving 
different needs. The grid is a different way of depicting the same concept. 

The second reason I like the grid is that it makes the numbers visual. You can actually 
visualize all your prospects. And when you add up all the revenue from all the clients in 

70 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Back End: The Value Grid

the grid, and divide it by how many people came in, you know your lifetime value. This 
makes it a nice tactical tool for understanding your CAC and 30D cash value. Both are very 
important and interlinked metrics for acquiring customers. 

A simple value grid is shown below.

From this grid, you can see at the bottom, that from 10 prospects coming into the 
business, eight of them take a simple trial offer, and three of them convert on the back end 
to a paid offer. This means that the business generates a total of $600 from 10 prospects. 
They can afford $60 per show. And the amount of money they collect per trial in the first 30 
days is $75. This makes $75 the 30D Cash/ 30D LTV.

From these numbers, if I had a credit card, I could put $600 on my credit card to buy 
ads to get 50 leads, and get 10 of them to walk in the door. This would mean that I could 
break even at $12 per lead. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 71



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

But what I’m not taking into account are the very real costs of working the leads 
and selling them into a trial, which indeed also costs money. Realistically, it would cost 
probably $600–$1,000 in labor to work the leads and sell them. I’ll use $600 for the sake 
of illustration. That would mean that I would now only be able to pay $0/lead, because all 
$600 of the revenue generated was eaten up by fixed costs. This is a situation that is all too 
familiar to small business owners. It costs too much money to acquire customers. The reality is 
it never costs “too much” or “too little”. It just costs what it costs. It’s up to us to design our 
business in such a way that we “make more money” from the same customers to be able to 
not only “afford” them but profit from them.

Here’s how. Let’s compare these numbers to the same hypothetical business that has 
gone through this process of stacking offers (what I’m about to show you).

72 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Back End: The Value Grid

From this grid, we see the business made a different front-end offer. They made a high-
ticket offer of some kind with some downsells, then took the person through a series of 
upsell offers over the first 30 days of their time in the business. Not every person took every 
offer, but some people did. And those percentages of people add up. All the way to the right 
you can see the revenue per client. And at the bottom you can see the totals and averages. 

Look at the difference in those numbers between the top example (30D Cash = $75) and 
the bottom example (30D Cash = $1,763). Both of these grids are for the same type of 
business. This is the difference between making a killing and getting killed. This is how you can 
outspend anyone on any platform. 

You may be wondering how some of the people who came in and said “no” to the initial 
offer still generated revenue. Easy: we offered them a complementary wellness/lifestyle review 
just for coming in. At this review, we sold them supplements even though they did not 
want to buy services from us, thereby making money from people who said “no”. That’s an 
offer I call “Free With Alternate Revenue Stream”. I break it down in depth a few chapters 
from here.  

Pretty cool when stuff actually works, right?
The difference in revenue generated between the two examples is about 14–15x. This 

is exactly what was happening with this consulting client in his business compared to my 
business. In the real world, it means that if your competitor can pay only $100 per lead, you 
could pay $1,500 per lead and remain just as profitable. Utilizing an upsell framework like 
this can be one of, if not the greatest, competitive advantages of all time. It also gives you 
enormous “margin for error” on your marketing and allows you the luxury of not needing 
the “best” marketing of all time. With a series of Grand Slam Offers increasing your lifetime 
value, you can still crush your competition even with mediocre marketing. Having this type 
of revenue per lead unlocks scale unlike you’ve ever experienced. It is the key for unending 
growth.  

So…now that we covered how amazing of an impact this strategy can have on your 
business, the question remains—how do we do it?

Advanced Offer Stacking: How To

“The amount of money you make is directly proportional to the amount of goodwill you have 
multiplied by the amount of offers you make.” - Frank Kern, timeless copywriter & marketer

Before we dive into this, there is one strong warning I must make. Adding more offers 
and services is a fast track to adding operational complexity. That makes business hard. If 
you’re looking at your own business, you want to look at things that you can do to add 
revenue that add little to no cost (time, money, or complexity). If something is going to add 
complexity, it had better be worth it (lots of profit or very little cost)—keep that ratio high. 

I think of a conversion process like an accommodating resistance exercise. What it 
means is that in exercise physiology, the “perfect” rep is a repetition of an exercise that 
maximally matches your ability to generate force at every point in an exercise, and with 
each repetition should get proportionally lighter so that you are always at 100% effort at all 
times. This allows you to work a muscle more efficiently, gaining strength and muscle faster. 
For example, you’re much stronger at the top of a squat than you are at the bottom. This 
is why experienced lifters add bands and chains to their barbells, it gets harder at the top 
where they are strongest, and lessens at the bottom where they are weaker. To date, there is 
no machine/apparatus that does this perfectly. But understanding the concept is how I think 
about selling. I want to match my ticket price and value perfectly to the buying ability and 
desire of each customer without increasing the complexity of my business. This is where the 
creative fun begins. 

Identify Adjacent Customer Needs/Opportunities

First, I look at all the revenue streams a customer is buying that are related to the core 
desires I am solving… power, money, beauty, weight loss, etc. 

Then see if I can create affiliate relationships (a relationship where another business 
owner pays you to send them customers). Or if I can add it in with little to no operations, 
I’ll do that. Adding in a sales consult to sell physical products is an example where the only 
added complexity is a meeting with the customer. That is usually worth the cost of making 
lots more money per customer. Here’s what the “need” streams look like before and after 
they have been turned into revenue opportunities:

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 75



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Most businesses refer out lots of revenue. They make recommendations of products or 
services that are complementary to their own. Over time, though, you’ll find that constantly 
thinking with this mindset adds up. At the time of this writing, I have directly made more 
than $3,000,000 just in affiliate commissions. Those pennies, since they are pure profit, go 
straight to your bottom line and should not be underestimated. 

For example, take a small business owner who makes $35,280 per year take-home off of 
$282,240/year in revenue. Adding in $2,000/mo in retail sales commissions may not seem 
like a lot when compared to the $23,520 their business is making off selling services, but the 
added $2,000/mo takes their take-home income from $35,280 to $59,280, which is life-
changing for many. Do not underestimate it. 

That being said, if something you refer out makes even more money, sometimes it’s 
worth buying/incorporating that business altogether.

Advanced Offer Stacking: How To

Pro Tip: Free Onboarding

 I was able to pay for my entire onboarding team and customer support team 
by adding an additional call to our onboarding process for new clients. They 
appreciated the extra support, and I was able to guarantee each of my customers 
clicked each of my affiliate links when signing up for the solutions they needed. 
I only had to cover the cost of the additional role in the company for the first 
month out of pocket. After that, the affiliate commissions I received literally 
paid for the team. These little “tricks” are the things that add up to making your 
business unbeatable while providing unmatched service to your customers.

Ultimate Offer Stacking Process

Now, back to stacking the offers. First, we figure out all the needs we can monetize. 
Next, we decide how we are going to choreograph the sales process. I use this framework 
for almost every business I work with to weave one of each core offer types together (after 
obviously using a free or discount hook).

1) Attract → 2) Up Front Cash → 3) Upsell/Downsell→ 4) Continuity

This gives me the best of all worlds. The Up Front Money Model allows me to profitably 
acquire customers. My upsells and downsells allow me to squeeze the most juice per prospect 
by getting the “whales” to buy big and the “minnows” into my world to buy something big 
later. Then, finally, I create consistent cash flow by tying in continuity. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 77



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Which Up Front Money Model, which upsell, and which type of continuity will rely 
heavily on the type of business I am working with and how their typical customer-buying 
journey is structured.

Mind you, after I have done this three-step process, I’ll often repeat it again and again. 
After this person has taken a continuity offer, I may offer additional services (additional 
continuity offer), then make an offer for them to prepay it for a bonus + a discount (up front 
cash). So if you were looking at this example it would look like this:

1) Attract → 2) Up Front Cash → 3) Upsell/Downsell→ 4) Continuity→  
5) Continuity #2→ 6) Up front Cash #2

This is how you continue to keep stacking profits in your business. You make money 
or break even in the acquisition, and you can continue to make offers to your clients. Each 
time, you’re increasing the LTV of the customer, and ultimately, how much you can spend 
to acquire them. 

This concept is very simple but incredibly powerful. In many ways, I wrote all of $100M 
Money Models to get to this part. Let’s do a few examples to really drive it home and make 
it real.

Sample Weight Loss Offer Flow

1) Attraction  2) Upsell/Downsell 3) Continuity 4) Attraction

I know this looks complicated. It’s not. Each of the sales flows naturally to the next over 
the span of their time with us. They do not need to take every offer, but we are still going to 
try. Not only that, in this example, you can see how I am showing the downsells at each step. 
If you are selling in-person or over the phone, in any one-on-one setting really, these are 
things that you can do effortlessly. Selling off a page digitally, you will not have this luxury, 
which is why I am such a big fan of one-on-one sales. It affords you flexibility and allows 
you to perfectly match the buying power of the prospect with your ability to sell and solve 
their needs on their budget. And when you do this, and you are competing against people 
who do not sell like this, you will almost always be able to outspend them.

Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

In the example above, we are selling services, then products. Then we are selling them 
continuity. Then we are selling them some sort of prepayment discount. Some of these sales 
can happen in the same conversation. Others need to be spaced out. This is what is actually 
happening to create those sales from the grid I showed earlier.

Sale #1: Service Sale (Up Front Cash)

On a micro-level, we are offering a high-ticket solution first. A certain percentage of 
customers will take that big ticket offer. But if they say no, totally fine. We transition to a 
half down version of the same offer with a different payment plan. If they still say no, we 
transition to a quarter down, with a slightly higher payment plan over time. If they still say 
no, we shorten the duration of the program and offer just the quarter payment down with 
no payment plan. If they still say no, then they probably don’t trust you and you need to 
work on sales, but that’s beyond this book. But if they still say no, then we would downsell 
a free trial and put their card on file and get them to commit to consuming our services to 
increase the likelihood they convert on the back end. And if they still say no, they don’t want 
our services, then to maintain goodwill we offer a complementary nutrition orientation. At 
that orientation, which might be 24 to 72 hours later, we begin our next series of offers.

Sale #2: Physical Products Sale (Upsell Offer)

At this orientation, after providing some individualized support/value, we would attempt 
to sell them on a three-month bundle of a full stack of supplements that still help solve their 
main need…just in a different way. If they said no, we would offer just a one-month supply 
and put them on a subscription for a discount. If they still said no, we would cross out a 
handful of the products and just give them the essentials. If they still said no, we would 
give them the one to two products they absolutely should take. After that, we ask if they 
need help preparing their food, then we would sell different meal plan prices of a food prep 
company we had created a relationship with. This helps the customer get results, saves time, 
and makes us money. Everyone wins.

Pro Tip: Another Example of One-on-One Free Onboarding

The cash I made from the products I sold at orientation covered my payroll to 
onboard every customer one-on-one. And, my trainers ended up making more 
per hour than they did taking on personal training clients. So they were happy 
to do it. My customers loved the added service. And, I still made enough profit 
most times to cover my entire cost of acquisition (advertising, commissions, and 
payroll) all off of these product sales. 

Compare that to the guy down the street always trying to “cut costs” or who 
is “afraid” of simply making more offers to customers. His employees would 
make less than mine, so he couldn’t keep the best talent. His customers would 
get worse service and spend less with him, so they’d get worse results. And, 
he made less money, so he couldn’t expand as fast or market to get as many 
customers. In a competitive market, it’s obvious which way of doing business 
wins in the end. Bottom line: People like having problems solved for them in 
advance, so solve them and profit.

Sales #3: More Services Sale (Continuity)

In the third sale, we are meeting with this customer a few weeks later. We are now 
positioning this as a “Feedback” meeting. This is how we get valuable feedback about how 
they are enjoying the service. You should do this for any service you have. First, because it 
gives you valuable information about what you can improve. Second, it allows you to save 
a customer who is not happy. Third, it provides an upsell opportunity. This is where if the 
client was having a great time, we would sell them on staying for the long haul. Again, first, 
we would start with a high ticket prepayment. Then downsell our way to simply closing 
them on continuity. 

If the client is not enjoying their time or feel like they need more support, we still 
naturally sell them a higher level program with more support. Every problem is an upsell 
opportunity. “Oh, you feel like we haven’t given you enough support, then how would 
you like it if we message you every morning and check in with you weekly. Would that 
help? Awesome. Then I think you’ll be a perfect fit for our VIP program. You can start for 
free today, in fact, I’ll even credit the entire cost of your first program to the VIP program 
because you didn’t have the best experience…” You get the idea. You just turn around and 
sell them your next Grand Slam Offer.

Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Sale #4: Prepay Sale or Last Chance (Up Front Cash, Downsell Continuity)

Finally, the last sale in this four-step sales process is getting them to prepay for services or 
becomes a last chance at getting them on continuity before the end of their treatment plan/
program/etc. This helps suck up some of the sales where people “weren’t sure” if they wanted 
to commit yet at the meeting beforehand. You can also use this as an opportunity to upsell 
those people who committed to continuity on the last example to prepay for a discount. 
Again, more cash up front. 

Weaving Them Together

This may seem like a lot, but done over 6 to 12 weeks, it’s not that overwhelming. And 
communicating with your clients more, will in general, make you more money. 

Notice a couple things. First, the big high value offer is our Grand Slam Offer. But in 
the real world, that Grand Slam Offer may have gotten them in the door. Not everyone 
says yes, so having another Grand Slam Offer in your back pocket will dramatically increase 
your closing percentage. The second thing to notice is that we still advance all prospects to 
the next stage, even if they said no. This gives us another opportunity to provide value and 
monetize the person. Do you see how much more effective this is?

Now you may be thinking to yourself…how on earth am I going to do all that? Well, 
you start by adding one of these conversion opportunities that adds the most money at 
the lowest cost. Then when you get that down, you add the next one and so forth. Note: 
prospects want you to solve their problem. People like buying, they just don’t like being sold. 
This is where the Grand Slam Offers come in and make it fun for the buyer and the salesman 
because everyone likes selling a good deal and everyone likes buying them. A win-win. 

Layering these offers together, one at a time, and creating downsells, is what makes your 
conversion process wildly efficient, not letting a dollar of spending power go to waste. 

Four Steps To Picking The Right Offer For Your Money Model

Money models are built off a series of offers. Each offer—or series of offers—satisfies a 
stage of your Money Models. 

We lower CAC. We maximize 30-Day GP. Then, we maximize lifetime GP. And the way 
I do things, each stage has different offer types that fit that goal. But no matter the type of 
offer, I follow the same process when adding a new offer to my Money Model. It goes like 
this: Right stage. Right problem. Right way. Right time. 

82 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Advanced Offer Stacking: How To

Right Stage. First, I make sure the offer fits the stage of the Money Model. If I want to 
get new customers at a reasonable price, I focus on Attraction Offers. If I want to increase 
30-Day GP, I add upsells and downsell offers. If I need to maximize lifetime GP, I focus on 
Continuity Offers. Once I know the offer meets the goal, I move on to the next step. 

Right Problem. Customers have many problems. You can’t solve them all. So, I prefer 
to pick problems that make sense for my business, that I can solve with existing resources, 
and that provide customers big value when solved. 

Right Way. Third, I solve based on the customer’s preference. Say two people want to 
lose weight. One might want to change their workouts. The other might want to change 
their food. You can try to convince people your way is the right way. But most times, they’re 
just gonna go to someone who solves the problem how they want it solved. So, I prefer to 
present effective options people already want. 

Right Time. Fourth, and most importantly, I offer to solve their problem at the right 
time. Someone might be hungry. But if you ask them if they want another steak after they 
are full, they’ll probably say no. So to sell the most, I make my offer at the time of greatest 
need. 

Summary

First, figure out the stage of your Money Model. Then, make sure your offers fit that 
stage. Then, make sure your offers solve the right problem for the customer, the way they 
like it, at the moment they need it the most—not when it’s convenient for you.

Attraction Offer: Free Presentations

Lost Chapter Author Note: **I ended up cutting this because it got too close to pitching 
and selling. A book maybe for another time. But this is one of the most widely used 
ways to get customers. It’s not incredibly compelling but it is simple and effective.**

June 2015.
It was a huge marketing conference. I scanned the speaker list and a presentation caught 

my eye.
“How My Weird Niche Funnel is Making Me $17,137 Per Day…And How You Can 

Ethically Copy It In Under 10min Or Less”
I didn’t have anything to do with gyms, but it looked more interesting than the other 

options. Besides, if I could find something useful in all this marketing stuff, I’d consider it 
a win. I’d have been thrilled to take home $17,137 a month let alone per day! So I went to 
check it out.

The room was packed to the brim. I barely had room to stand. He started the presentation 
by dropping a bomb. 

“I’m giving away my Ferrari to someone here today. All you have to do is opt-in at this 
website to find out more.”

Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

What!? He made it sound like it was no big deal. It was his Ferrari! This guy must be legit.
He then told us about his special money-making websites. He made them in a specific 

way and put them in a special order to make people buy more of his stuff. Then, he showed 
us a bit about how to make them for ourselves. 

What he did clearly worked. And it made a lot of sense. Too much sense. If I did what 
he did, I could get what he had. I was sold before he even presented an offer. 

If he had started with “Hey everyone, come buy my website designer for $2,000,” no 
one would have bought. But sixty minutes in, I bet a third of the room would have taken 
out their credit cards. I sure would’ve. That’s the power of using presentations to get people 
to buy your stuff. They work. 

Description

Buyers need to know “enough” stuff about your product to buy. And the more expensive or 
complex the thing, the more information they need. Presentations that educate the audience 
with the intention of converting them into customers excel at bridging this information gap. 
They work especially well for complex and expensive stuff for three reasons: 

1)	 You have a captive audience.

Presentations require people’s attention. So if a person shows up to a presentation, 
you have a good chance they will pay more attention than they would in other “noisy” 
advertising environments.

2)	 You keep them for a long enough time to explain the thing and provide 
value. 

Just like presentations require people’s attention (and they know it), they also understand 
that presentations have a time investment. So if a person shows up to a presentation, you 
have a good chance they’ll not only pay more attention, but they’ll do it for longer. This 
makes presentations perfect for making sure leads have all the information they need—you 
have their attention long enough to actually go through it all. 

3)	 You make your offer when they’re the most motivated to take it.

A good presentation clarifies the problem they came to solve, what life would be like 
after your thing solves their problem, how fast and easy it is, showcases loads of people like 
them who have succeeded with it, and resolves their most common concerns about buying. 

86 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Attraction Offer: Free Presentations

By the end, people should see a fast, easy, low-risk way to solve their problems. And at that 
moment, they will be the most motivated to buy. So that’s when we make our offer. 

Presentations can last anywhere from 15 seconds to 15 days. The exact length of the 
presentation matters less, only that the more expensive and more complicated the thing, the 
longer they tend to get. 

For example, when looking at Gym Launch, 78% of customers consumed at least 
two pieces of “long-form” content before making a purchase. This was a ground-breaking 
finding. We then reverse-engineered our sales process to force people to consume at least two 
long form pieces of content. This turned “total strangers” into people who wanted to buy 
our stuff. 

This consumption process reverse engineers the trust process to create qualified prospects 
who are ready to buy. This is the core of marketing: educating a consumer to the point of 
making a purchasing decision. Sometimes it’s a 60-second ad if you’re selling a $67 physical 
product or it’s a two-day workshop to sell $100,000 consulting services.

Bottom line: The amount of time you take educating the consumer is directly related to 
the price and the amount of trust needed. The bigger the plane, the longer the runway has to 
be in order for the plane to take off. A toy plane can take off in about twenty feet, whereas a 
747 “Dreamlifter” needs almost two miles. 

Free Education with Offer Examples
Free XYZ Dinner / Free Neuropathy Dinner / Free Diabetic Dinner

Free dinner gets people in the door, and during the meal you make a presentation 
between 60 and 90 minutes. At the end of the presentation, you make an offer for a product 
that covers the cost of getting everyone to the dinner. Ideally, more. Of those who buy, you 
set up individual appointments to offer a much higher ticket item. 

Benchmark: Aim to convert a quarter of the room to the lower offer. Of those who 
take the lower offer, aim to convert at least a third of them to the higher offer. For example, 
a 100-person audience would have 25 or so people taking the lower offer and eight or so 
people taking the higher offer.

Free 90-minute Masterclass:

Then, make your offer on Friday. This works well for converting ice-cold audiences for 
lower cost and very high-cost offers alike. Each day you would focus your presentation on 
some core belief that prevents them from buying and, along the way, provide enough useful 
content they can apply today and get value from it today.

finding, the days of the week do not matter. Do them whenever is most convenient for you 
and your team. 

Structure each of the days (4+ presentations) around one of the core beliefs (found

that the person you are on the phone with: 1) Has the budget for what you are selling 2) 
Has the authority to make a buying decision (or will have those people on the next call) 3) 
Wants what you are selling 4) Wants to start within the timeframe you deem optimal. The

Pro Tips

Presentations, whether one at 60–90 minutes (like the dinner), or 12+ at 60+ 
minutes (like the summit) all serve to play on the three core limiting beliefs. The 
more presentations you have the deeper you can get. Their function stays the 
same either way.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 89



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Three core limiting beliefs: 
1)	 The results must come easy.
2)	 I must get the best results possible.
3)	 Results must lead to attention and approval. 

1)	 Results must come easy
ʶ	 This product is easy to use. This is not frustrating or overwhelming. You can do it.
ʶ	 This product/service lives up to claims. Here’s how the universe will work to help 

you. It is fair. It will work.
ʶ	 It was unfair before this because you had an information disadvantage, but now you 

don’t.
ʶ	 If the universe is unfair, then life is horrible. But the universe will bend to your will 

now that you have earned it, and you will get status because you deserve it.

2)	 I must get the best results possible 
ʶ	 If you have messed up in the past, and it’s not your fault. It’s someone else’s or 

something else’s fault.
ʶ	 Failing would make you feel horrible, which you won’t, which means this product 

is awesome.

3)	 Results must lead to attention and approval - aka - status 
ʶ	 This product will position you above other people. Here’s how you can get everyone 

to act the way you want to act and be treated the way you want to be treated. 
External forces will bend to your will.

ʶ	 If people have not acted the way you wanted in the past, it’s not your fault—it’s 
someone else’s or something else’s fault.

ʶ	 If people don’t do what you want, then they are horrible, but people will, which is 
why this works.

Anything that will get more people to consume will boost sales. This is why email 
follow-up, text campaigns, and other participation-based value ads create higher conversion 
numbers. As a rule to sell by—the more time they spend with you, the more money they’ll spend 
with you.

Attraction Offer: Free Presentations

The better the messaging is at aligning and playing to the three core beliefs the better 
your conversion will get.

Long-form presentation-based selling depends on providing value through entertainment, 
life lessons, and breaking limiting beliefs. Your focus should be to get them to watch the 
whole thing, provide value in an entertaining way, and build goodwill. Long-form offers 
excel at converting cold traffic into buyers. And they work particularly well selling one to 
many with larger audiences.

Summary

In general, the more expensive the offer, the more audiences want to learn about it 
before they make a purchase. In general, the colder the audience, the more exposure to 
a brand, business, or person it takes to build trust. This makes high-ticket offers to cold 
audiences one of the most difficult things to do in business. To make it work, you have to 
play the long-game on the front-end. The free education-with-offer forces as much exposure 
as it can in as short of a window as reasonable. 

ʶ	 Free education, classes, activities, challenges, etc., build goodwill with warmer 
audiences and trust with colder ones. The more exposure they get the higher ticket 
your offer can get. The faster they can get the exposure, the sooner you can make the 
offer with success.

ʶ	 Long-form methods do a great job at converting cold traffic into buyers and the best 
job when converting from larger audiences. 

ʶ	 Long-form presentation-based methods focus on providing value through 
entertainment, life lessons, and touching on limiting beliefs. They aim to retain 
the audience’s attention throughout, deliver value in an engaging way, and build 
goodwill.

ʶ	 Presentations, whether single 60–90 minute sessions or multiple hour-long sessions, 
align with three core limiting beliefs: results must come easy, results must be the best 
possible, and results must, in some way, lead to attention and approval.

ʶ	 More and longer presentations delve deeper into these beliefs. It just comes down to 
keeping engagement during the presentation and maximizing the number of people 
who show up for the next.

ʶ	 Follow-up efforts, SMS campaigns, and providing value before and after purchase 
can increase engagement, show rates, and then conversion rates.

Attraction Offer: Freemium

Lost Chapter Author Note: **I ended up cutting this because I didn’t think 
it applied to enough businesses. But if you have a software or media business 

(any business that has close to 100% incremental margins) this is a dangerous 
but effective money model used by billion dollar companies.**

I learned this by studying how freemium software companies upsold me. That being 
said, almost every one of the companies listed in the examples section has funding. If you 
do not have investors and large amounts of capital, I would not recommend this structure. 

That being said, I am including it as a way of presenting a complete picture of possible 
approaches. If you have something incredibly valuable—so valuable that lots of people come 
towards you without marketing—then you have something that qualifies for this structure. 
Otherwise, steer clear.

Description

Freemium is one of the most dangerous acquisition strategies, but also can be one of 
the most powerful. This is definitely an advanced move. To be honest, I’ve seen it done 
incorrectly by really smart people more times than I’ve seen it done correctly. One of the key 
points to understand about freemium is that it is not a business model, it is an acquisition 
strategy. That’s a very important distinction. 

The idea is, you give something away that is so valuable that people come to get it and 
continually use it for free. They must come from word of mouth because the product is so 
good. It must cost $0 to get them to use it (or just enough advertising to get it going so it 
then spreads virally). That is where this gets tricky. 

Examples

Dropbox (Online Storage)
Free storage…up to a point. Then after that, you pay. 

Spotify (Free Music App)
Free music forever, with ads. Remove ads for a fee. 

Wistia (Video Hosting)
Free video uploads. After a certain amount you need to pay more. 

Gmail storage
Free email. After a certain period, upgrade for more inbox space or start having your emails 
deleted. Fear of loss makes you upgrade.

Attraction Offer: Freemium

Free Versus Discount Note

This offer only works with 100% free strategies. It does not work with a discount 
variation.

Details

Here’s what it looks like when done right: You give away a core piece of software that 
provides value to someone’s life or business. They don’t value it enough to pay for it, but if 
it’s free they will use it continually. This means you get hundreds, or thousands, or hundreds 
of thousands of people coming to you…for free. Ad spend: $0. 

The idea is to then use your marketing and sales team to make offers to these “customers” 
to upsell them into higher levels of service. This gives your sales team a pool of “free leads” to 
upsell. It’s always easier to upsell someone than to sell them. Designing this can be incredibly 
challenging. You must give something away that 1) costs you almost nothing to fulfill, 2) 
provides continuous value (not one-time), and 3) doesn’t give away so much of the farm that 
they’ll never want to buy something else. A very difficult balance. 

In businesses selling to businesses, one of the key ways of doing this is giving something 
away that exposes a hole in their business, something that your next paid product solves. 

In a business selling to consumers, this typically comes in the form of giving away 
something people use. At the same time, it limits their use in some way that anyone who 
would regularly use it would need more of. Either through advertising or limits that once 
they start using it, they would want to increase. 

You’ll notice this play works well with software because software is 1) virtually free for 
each additional user and 2) intended to provide continuous value. So the “only” part you 
have to nail is how much and exactly what to give away (which is still very hard). 

Your true cost of acquisition when using this model is understanding what percentage 
of free customers upgrade, and determining your cost of servicing a free customer. So, for 
example, if it costs you .05/mo to service a free customer, and you upsell 1% of customers, 
then your cost of acquisition is .05/mo divided by .01 = $5/mo. As long as your average 
revenue per paid user is $15/mo+ you’ll have a profitable business that could grow. Because, 
again, remember that you still have costs of doing business before you start to profit.

Here’s what it looks like when done wrong: You give away your core thing. People use it 
for free. Then they don’t want to buy your next thing. Now you are just running a business 
that loses money servicing customers for free. 

Roadblocks

Here are just a handful of the problems you can encounter with this model.

#1 Conversion Problem: Conversion percentage from free to paid is too low. 

#2 Value Problem: You give away something that people don’t find valuable 
enough to tell other people about. You spend money marketing your free thing, 
and still people don’t want to tell enough people about it for you to be profitable. 

#3 Cost Problem: People want it. They tell their friends about it, but your 
costs of fulfilling them for free are too high relative to what you make from paid 
customers. So you are not profitable. 

Summary Points

Overall, freemium is a very hard strategy to get right. It’s also something that can be very 
powerful. If it’s your first rodeo, and you don’t know everything there is to know about a 
freemium acquisition strategy, then I would definitely not recommend it.

This is a billion dollar strategy that I mostly included for completeness. I think you need 
to be a seasoned pro and know your numbers like you know your children’s names. If you 
can nail it, though, you can get unlimited free leads and viral growth as a result. 

It’s important to remember that this isn’t a business model. It’s an acquisition strategy. 
It has to be free and valuable enough to spread, but not so valuable that customers use it 
without upgrading. If you use this strategy, good luck! You’re a smarter man/woman than 
I am.

But with skill, it’s a great goodwill play that also makes money and generates leads.**

June 2020. Austin, Texas.
I could see the Texas heat bouncing off the hood of the car as we drove. The roads were 

empty, not a car in sight. It was like driving through a ghost town, except the town was our 
home. It was in the thick of the COVID-19 lockdowns. As Leila and I were driving back 
from the pharmacy for some goods, we saw a young girl on the side of the road frantically 
waving a sign.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 97



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Free Car Wash
Intrigued, I said “I wonder what the deal is. There’s gotta be something to it. Wanna go 

check it out?”
Leila obliged my whim, as she had many times in the past. She knew just how much 

I love going through sales processes. So I turned the wheel of the car toward the girl and 
headed up the ramp next to her. Around the bend, we rolled our car into the main car wash 
lane. As we pulled up, a man stood up from his seat in the shade. We came to a stop and 
rolled down the window. He pointed at the pricing chart and exhaled his spiel, which it 
became clear he had already done hundreds of times already that day.

“The standard wash is 100% free but we’re accepting donations on behalf of the staff to 
help the guys feed their families and get through this. We would all be very appreciative. We 
accept cash, credit, and Venmo.” Then he shut up, and said nothing. 

I got the hint and took out a twenty dollar bill.  Looking at the pricing board, it was 
more expensive than the most expensive automated wash they charged for even during 
normal conditions. He grabbed the twenty, and gave me a ticket and waved me on. 

I’m always pro-business, and always will be. I felt great about helping a group of working 
men out. That being said, it had a very different feel than any normal purchase. Normally 
we buy things and don’t think much past the transaction. In this instance, my purchase 
was funding something great—the American dream. As we went through the wash line, 
I couldn’t shut up about it. 

“How great was that!? Goodwill. Lots of new business. Cash flow on a high margin 
service. Brilliant. I’m definitely figuring out a version of this for the gyms.”

And in the middle of COVID, our gyms began using this scripting in their sales process 
and it worked wonderfully. People who couldn’t normally close were able to get an average 
ticket of about $99 which is more than the average low barrier offer. It was splendid. I’ll give 
you the details about how to do it below and how you can apply an offer like this to attract 
new customers. 

Description

You market the promotional offer as free. When the person gets to the checkout, you 
give them an offer to pick their own price. You will explain the benefits of investing more 
equating to higher investment in their own results. If they’re after results, the more they pay, 
the more they will pay attention.

Free Versus Discount Note

This offer does not work with a discount wrapper

Details

To further incentivize them paying, you offer bonuses for three levels of payment (think 
small, medium, large) to encourage them to pay something more than $0. Ultimately, if 
someone doesn’t want to pay for the first thing, you must give them the basic level for free. 
That being said, you can and should still upsell them on other products and services during 
their time with you. 

This is similar to a limited free offer except instead of “either or,” you have a sliding scale 
with no predetermined amounts, only rungs. It also has no max. People can pay whatever 
they want. 

You want to make sure that at the beginning of the sale you explain that you do have a 
pick-your-price type setup and that the staff is offering different “bonuses” at different levels, 
but they are not obligated to pay anything. It’ll seem like they are paying the employees, not 
the business, which for some reason people feel better about (even though businesses pay 
employees…sigh). 

Explaining that you are accepting donations/allowing people to pick their own price will 
avoid any awkwardness at the end. You also get the goodwill of the prospect by being up 
front. 

When selling with that pre-frame, though, you can and should hit the prospect hard 
with confrontational questions to ensure they would be a good long-term candidate. If 
you feel as though they have no intention of staying, weed them out. Be genuine about this. 
This should feel like an interview. The types of clients you want are the ones who willingly 
pay and are appreciative. This is sort of a mini-test for that. Ask real questions to gauge 
commitment level for their own good and yours. Examples: Are you willing to change the way 
you do X? Are you willing to stop doing Y? What if life gets busy, will you stop showing up? Will 
you attend all of these appointments? 

Make sure that the thing you are giving away for free has low operational costs so you 
can still give it to people without burning out your staff. Save the higher operational cost 
stuff for the people who choose to pay. 

100 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Attraction Offer: Free Pick Your Price

After you get to the end of the pitch, you will outline what they get at each level, then 
say “we accept Visa, Mastercard, or XYZ payment, which would you prefer to use?” Then 
shut up. They will take out their card and tell you what level they want. It’s hard for people 
to say no. 

Summary Points

These offers can generate a lot of goodwill when done properly. People feel good when 
they buy them because it is not a demand, it is a choice. It pulls on people’s generosity. 
People feel 100% in control of their own destiny, and you can play up the fact that you 
are helping folks for free. It sets up a relationship based on goodwill and sets the stage for 
future upsells. On top of that, the conversion rate is very high, although the ticket average is 
typically lower with this type of play. It works well in low-trust environments because it has 
so much goodwill loaded into it. It is one of the easier “free upsells” that exist. 

Pro Tip: PAID VERSION of “Pick Your Price”

I saw an art gallery use the play this way: every piece of art had a price range. 
They said people could choose how much they wanted to support the artist. 
For example, “this painting is between $149 and $299”. I asked the owner how 
it worked. She told me most people pay more than the halfway point because 
they don’t want to seem cheap or unsupportive. This version is half goodwill, 
half capitalism. I like it. Give it a try if it fits your business.

Upsell Of﻿fer: Free With Alternate Revenue Stream

Lost Chapter Author Note: **I removed this upsell because I 
didn’t think enough businesses would be able to use it.**

2019ish.
The following is a rough paraphrasing from a story a gym owner told me that taught me: 1) 

an excellent downsell/upsell strategy, and 2) a really nice way to graciously exit anyone from a 
sales conversation who doesn’t want to buy your main product.

When someone walks in, tours the place, and says no to joining—which used to kill 
me—I had this realization. Instead of awkwardly escorting them out of my gym, why not 
offer them something free instead? Instead, I say, “No worries,” and hand them a USB drive. 
“Here’s everything you need to do this program from home, absolutely free.”

You should see their faces. In this industry where everyone’s trying to lock you into 
contracts, they think I’m some kind of saint. But here’s the real move—after I give them the 
USB, I simply add:

“To get you a head start, let’s book you for a nutrition orientation so you can see the 
results you want. The orientation is on us. We just want to get this community healthy, and 
maybe when you can afford it, you’ll think of us.”

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 103



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Almost 100% of the people who said no to my gym membership end up in these nutrition 
orientations. And guess what? During these orientations, we sell them supplements instead 
of workout programs.

The crazy part? These people who initially rejected working out spend 50% more on 
supplements than my regular clients. I’ve basically created a “no prospect left behind” 
approach, and my sales team loves it because they help everyone who walks in.

Everyone around here calls it “the no sale sale”. Perfect name, right? I’m selling to people 
who think they aren’t buying anything.

And once I started doing that, I thought to myself, “why not offer this free USB as my 
front end just to get people in? Then I can upsell them an in-person version for money - or 
- they can keep buying supplements from us every month and not even use up gym space. 
Win-win.” So, that’s what I did. And, it worked.

***

It goes to show that people want the same problem solved in different ways. Offering 
multiple ways to solve their problem gives you a few more at-bats. What’s more, this strategy 
allowed him, and the gyms who subsequently modeled it in our community, a way to turn 
every single prospect into a sale. 

There are a few ways to use it, so let’s dive in. As a downsell, like in the story. Or, as a 
primary offer, which he alludes to at the end. We’ll dive into both.

Description

This is an offer that depends strongly on the types of monetization/revenue streams 
available to a business. In the simplest terms, we are providing one type of service (or 
product) for free, and upselling something else.

You can upsell something as a one-time service or product to offset advertising costs. 
Or, you can make the upsell recurring. Or you can plan your entire business around giving 
one thing away for free and monetizing with another. It works for one-time services or even 
recurring services, provided the alternative revenue stream has sufficiently high margins to 
afford both fulfillment types. But most variations chunk up to two larger buckets:

Paired Upsell: I give you thing A for free, in exchange for buying thing B.

104 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Upsell Offer: Free With Alternate Revenue Stream

OR 
Independent Upsell: I give you thing A for free, and I will encourage you to buy 
thing B. 

Those are all slightly nuanced ways of expressing the same concept/offer. But they will 
hopefully generate some different ideas for you on how to use this in your business or your 
clients’ businesses. 

Examples

Storage 

Offer: You get a free month of storage. 
Paired Upsell: Do you want to buy a lock for your storage unit? (The only locks that fit our 
doors are the ones we sell and cannot be purchased anywhere else).

Weight Loss Clinic

Offer: Free 28-Day Program
Independent Upsell: (At nutrition orientation—kickoff of program after first sign up). You’re 
going to want this $400 supplement package to get the best results for the free 28 days of 
service.

Physical Therapist

Offer: 4 Free Treatments
Independent Upsell: You’re going to need these orthotics, bands, braces, oils, and athletic 
tape, to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment.

Info/Coaching/Education + Software

Offer: I will coach you for free indefinitely on your agency as long as you use our software. 
Paired Upsell: We monetize inherently on the software.

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 105



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Real Example: Free Book on Real Estate

Upsell #1: Shipping cost
Upsell #2: Audio version
Upsell #3: Deal contract templates
Upsell #4: Where to find deals—training
Upsell #5: How to find financing if you have no money
Note: Each of these things are necessary requisites for being successful using the strategies 
outlined in the book. The hardest sale is the first sale—the opportunity vehicle—the book. 
The rest of the upsells are the things they will need along the journey. 

Free Versus Discount Note

This works with a discount wrapper. “You can get service from us for only $5/
mo (normally $100/mo) as long as you continue to use our products.” 

An acquaintance of mine who owned a very successful chain of 200+ weight loss 
clinics grew it on this simple offer. They offered $5 per month of weight loss 
services for a year if and only if the client used their supplements, bars, shakes, 
and meal program. Their guarantee was also contingent on this continued usage/
purchasing. 

They were a successful business and employed doctors and nurses at the facilities, 
but despite this, gave their service away because they made so much on their 
consumable products. This gave me an interesting insight—people were more 
willing to pay for the products than they were for the service from white-coated 
medical professionals. People love tangible goods. Something I always try to 
incorporate with services if I can find a convenient way.

Details

You’ll want to use a multi-step sales process with this offer. If you are marketing “thing 
A” for free, then you must be able to give it away for free. So it is key that you give away 
something that has low incremental costs (i.e., adding another unit doesn’t cost much). 

106 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Upsell Offer: Free With Alternate Revenue Stream

If you are using it as a front-end offer, you want to make the next thing you are selling/
upselling them to be the next natural thing that the prospect would need. It is key to 
understand your prospect’s problem and the solutions available better than they do. That is 
where good money model design becomes paramount.

In the examples I gave, the money model does not end there. There are still more upsells 
that will occur in each of these scenarios:

ʶ	 Storage will upsell boxes, larger storage units, and commitment. 
ʶ	 Weight loss clinic will upsell continuity of service, continuity of supplements, done-

for-you meals, bars, hormone treatment, etc. They’ll also likely close a card for 
continuity of service so the free service is also a Free Trial + Penalty. This way you are 
capturing multiple streams of revenue. 

ʶ	 Physical therapists will probably upsell a long-term treatment program bundle.

The effectiveness of this play is based on: 
1) The prospect’s perception of how essential/required the next thing is (like the lock in 
the storage unit scenario). 
2) How seamless the upsell process is for the prospect. If you make it frictionless, you 
can get 90% plus take rates on upsells for these offers. They should feel like it makes total 
sense to buy it. 

The biggest benefit to using this offer as a free front end is being able to liquidate 
acquisition cost. If you make $0 on the free thing (naturally), but you know 80% take a 
$300 upsell with 80% margins, then you know you are making $300 x 80% x 80% = $192 
per free thing given away…and that’s just the first upsell. There will and should be many 
others. 

But since the take rate is so high, and it is up front, this is one of the easiest ways to 
generate cash up front with little to no operational drag. Physical and digital products pair 
very well with services for this specific money model.

We use this all the time for internal stuff. What I mean is using it to market to an 
existing audience. You can encourage them to bring friends for the free thing. They will 
be excited to do that and to participate. So it will end up generating new customers and 
revenue with an easy offer. Basically, this combines a free trial with an upsell. Since most of 
your clients take the offer, in many cases you can make more money going free + upsell than 
selling a moderately priced thing up front. Consider meeting with 100 folks and selling 30 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 107



Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

people a $99 thing versus meeting with the same 100 folks and selling all 100 a free thing, 
then upselling 80 of them on the $300 products. You end up with more money and more 
customers (plus the referrals). 

You can obviously use this up front. With cold traffic, you’re going to want to close a 
trial + credit card on the first transaction, then upsell product on the second, otherwise you 
will get a lot of no-shows.

NOTE: If someone does not buy the upsell, they are unlikely to stay. It’s the greatest 
predictor of back-end conversion. So although that sale may seem minor, it’s the most 
important for the long-term value of the customer. You must focus on it. It’s not a 
nice-to-have. It’s a must-have. 

Summary Points

Great internal play to your audience. Generates lots of referrals. Easy to sell. Pair it with 
a free trial for cold traffic so you can assume the back-end continuity and far better back-end 
conversion. Can generate more cash than selling something low(ish) ticket. Almost always 
gets a lot of volume in the door.

June 2017.
After launching 36 gyms by hand and getting absolutely crippled by payment processing 

problems (crazy story by the way—you can read all about it in $100M Leads), Leila and I 
had enough. We wanted to wind down Gym Launch and do a weight loss offer instead. But 
that meant I had lots of gyms to break the news to. And when I called up the first gym to 
cancel his launch—he refused! After some back and forth, he asked if I would just teach him 
instead of flying out to do the launch. I agreed. Gym Launch was saved. And, just like that, 
I stumbled on the Gym Launch licensing offer we still use today.

So instead of flying out, I provided our already-proven Gym Launch-ing stuff. Think 
ads, scripts, sales training, follow-up tactics and so on—and I licensed it all for $16,000. 
The stuff worked. Gyms using our materials made on average ~$30,000—almost twice their 
investment—in their first 30 days. For the average gym owner, that was life-changing. But I 
still had a looming problem.

Even though the product was expensive and worked, I could only sell each customer 
once. So after I sold it, that was it. A problem if you want to reinvest in growth and pay 
yourself (my preference, I like getting paid). So to solve it, I had to sell something else. A 
continuity product fit the bill. 

Even if I used all of the cash from the first purchase to get more customers, the continuity 
offer would keep money coming in. But, I didn’t have a continuity product. Boo. Then, I had 
a stroke of luck. A gym reached out and gave me the perfect opportunity…

“Hey man how are you d-” 
“I’m in.” 
“Uh…on what?” 
“Seriously? On your next thing. I’ve already made $55k in the last 6 weeks—a 340% 

return. So if your next thing is half as good as this, let me buy it yesterday.”
Gotta think fast. “So, uh, how’s your semi-private training going?”
“Huh, we actually don’t have any.” he replied.
“...how much do you make on supplements?”
“Zero. We don’t do that either.”
Feeling confident now. “What about churn? Hiring? Internal plays? You got those sorted?” 
“Uhh…not really.” His confidence dropping. Wind coming out of his sales.

Continuity Offer: Lifetime Upgrades 

Time for the offer. “I see. So…do you want to get out of the daily grind and actually scale 
a legit chain of gyms?”

He puffed back up. “Dude, that sounds awesome! Like I said—whatever you got, I’m 
in!” 

Downselling the upsell. “Alright. It’s a way higher price and you gotta stay longer, cool?”
“I think so,” he said. Getting a bit shaky.
“It’s…” punching numbers into my calculator. “...$42,000 per year. For three years.” 
He sat there. Silent. 
Shoot. Throw in the bonus. “And on top of that—you’ll get access before you start 

paying, cool?”
Taking out his own calculator, he looked shocked, then smirked. “Alex, that’s $3,200 per 

month. That’s 20% cheaper monthly than Gym Launch. You got a deal. What do I get first?”
Oh boy… “Well, that depends on what’s holding back your gym right now. So we’ll 

figure out the bottleneck, then I’ll make you a play that’ll solve it. We’ll repeat that process 
every two weeks until you’ve got more money than you know what to do with. Sound good? 

“Bi-weekly plays—specific to my gym? Fantastic. Let’s do it!” 

***

Little did he know. I had nothing ready—yet. I left that up to future Alex. But, I did 
know one thing. I had a continuity offer. One where I provided a new money-making play 
every fourteen days. Yikes. 

It was insane. And so were the results. I would keep this up for almost two years. It 
exhausted me to my core. But, it meant I could plow all the extra cash into getting more 
customers and get paid. So I did. And Gym Launch’s revenue went up more than 13X.  From 
~$300,000 per month to ~$4,000,000+ per month as a result. So…uh…it worked. 

This turned into an important lesson for me. Customers would start any offer if I made 
it tasty enough. But, they’d only stick if they had good reasons to. So I gave them one…every 
14 days. Our revenue kept scaling. Not because we sold more customers, but because I gave 
them good reasons to keep paying. So, a good offer got them to start, and good bonuses got 
them to stick.

Now, so can yours.

Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

Description

With the previous offers in this section, we got people to start our continuity program. 
Now, we focus on getting them to stick. So once they become customers—they stay customers. 

That said, we can get people to stick to continuity offers longer with bonuses. More 
value on top of the continuity product itself. So improving monthly stick means providing 
extra value, in some way, monthly. 

When I make a bonus, I think of “when” and “what”. For the “when” part, I use delays 
or milestones. This means how long they have to wait (delays) or what they have to do or 
achieve (milestones) to get the thing. 

For the “what,” I give them a one-time bonus, a variable bonus, or a lifetime upgrade. 
A one-time bonus, you give one time. Think of one thing, one use, one activity, or one-time 
access. A variable bonus, you give on a schedule, but it changes each time. And a lifetime 
upgrade means a permanent high-value change in continuity status—think an entire feature 
or service. 

This means that you simply pair a “when” with a “what”. Putting them together, the 
person has to wait a certain period or do certain stuff to get the bonus once, get a variable 
bonus on a schedule (like monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.), or get the same bonus forever. The 
time to the first bonus extends their stay one-time. And if you keep giving them bonuses, 
you can extend their stay more times.

If you’re not sure what bonus to offer, I think of it in two ways. First, how can I give 
them more or better of something. From a value equation perspective, think faster, easier, 
risk free. And finally, if you just want a list of different types of bonuses, refer to: Bonuses 
Chapter in $100M Offers - and - Feature Downsells in $100M Money Models. Both will give 
you different perspectives on types of bonuses.

All in all, you can probably make a continuity offer on anything that provides continuous 
value. You can get them to stick to that continuity offer longer by adding bonus value well 
after their first payment, and often. 

Examples

Delayed One-Time Bonus—Local Service
When: Stay a recurring customer for four months in a row and you become an “advanced 
member”
What: Get Access to Our Annual Customer Appreciation Palooza

Recurring Bonus—Consumable Physical Product

Continuous Use Physical Use: Car Lease 
When: Every 3,000 miles (milestone) or every six months (delay)
What: You can get the car serviced free (bonus) 

Important Notes

Make sure customers know about your bonuses. They can only get excited enough to 
stay longer to get it if they know it exists. So tell them! Whether they’re just signing up, or a 
year in, always let them know what comes next. And—if you have recurring bonuses—right 
after you give it to them, let them know about the next one. Always keep ‘em wanting more. 

How to tell customers about upcoming bonuses. Let customers know the type of 
bonus they get, but keep the bonus itself a surprise. This gives you flexibility and makes the 
bonus more valuable. In the Gym Launch example, customers knew they would get a new 
play from me every month. But I kept the exact play a surprise. To be clear, the bonus was on 
top of licensing stuff they already got. This made it both recurring and valuable. Which makes 
sense because we want them to pay as much as possible continuously.

Variable bonuses or Lifetime Upgrades. Unless your bonus gives a huge and permanent 
improvement, keep it variable. No matter how good you make your thing, customers will 
get used to it. So giving new stuff more often (even if less valuable) frequently keeps more 
customers interested longer. 

Making milestones for your milestone bonuses. As always, I try to make all my 
milestones either: things that make my customer more successful—think activation points. 
Or, things that make me successful—advertising on my behalf. Ideally, things that do both. 
For example, if publicly posting that they are starting a weight loss challenge will increase 
their adherence and advertise my business—then why not give them a bonus when they do 
it? Think of all the tips from the Win Your Money Back Chapter in $100M Money Models, 
all those apply. 

Combine bonuses when you can. You can combine both the “whens” and the “whats” 
from earlier. For the “whens,” you can have something that they get at a delay and another 
bonus they get only if they achieve a milestone. For the “whats,” a one-time bonus will get 
them to sign up and stay to that point. A recurring bonus (variable or lifetime upgrade) 
will keep them staying after. So you might put one big bonus for getting them to stay for X 
period, then another permanent upgrade after they get to Y period, and another one-time 
bonus after they achieve a milestone. Use ‘em all.  

With proper framing, you can make lots of stuff a variable bonus. The bonuses can 
be new things, better things *updates*, or more of what they already like. Giant streaming 
services do all three. They already have more stuff than any one person could ever consume. 
Ever. But they still come out with new shows, more seasons of shows people like, and better 
ways to match content to viewers’ preferences. 

Give customers status and bragging rights when they unlock bonuses. Once customers 
unlock a big bonus, change their label. For instance, after someone stays six months, you 
might go from calling them a customer to a “VIP”. Smart cookies like us align the label with 
traits of loyal customers. From a customer to “committed,” “lifer,” “advanced,” “invested,” 
“all-in,” “elite,” and so on. Bonus points if you make the label something they can brag 
about and feel bad about losing. Kinda like airlines with their super double diamond status.

Celebrate status changes publicly. The more you can pair status changes with little 
ceremonies or graduations—the more value the status change has. The more status they gain, 
and the more the status gets them, the less they’ll want to lose it. And—by extension—getting 
them to stick. You can do these as monthly, quarterly, or when you have big achievements 
to celebrate.

Summary Points

ʶ	 To get more people to stick for the long term, give them bonuses over the long term.
ʶ	 When making bonuses you want to know the “when” and “what”. 
ʶ	 “When” you give a bonus is either on a delay or from a milestone.
ʶ	 Delayed bonuses you give after a specified number of payments or time has passed. 
ʶ	 Milestone bonuses you give after the customer does something or achieves a result. 
ʶ	 “What” type of bonus you give: one-time, variable, and lifetime upgrades.
ʶ	 One-time bonuses happen once and extend the duration of a customer’s tenure once. 

So, you may need to give lots of one-time bonuses over time to keep them staying…
over time.

ʶ	 Variable bonuses give a different thing each time. 
ʶ	 Lifetime upgrade bonuses give additional features or services. 
ʶ	 You can combine bonuses. The more incentives someone has to start and stick, the 

better. 
ʶ	 When somebody earns a big bonus, give them a new label to show their superior 

status. 
ʶ	 Make the bonus a big deal to the customer—and do it in public if they feel OK 

with it.

Continuity Offer: Lifetime Discounts

Get Them To Stick

Lost Chapter Author Note: **This chapter delineates lifetime versus one-time discounts. It 
was in an earlier version of $100M Money Models, but I cut it out since I think a lot of people 
would cut their prices too much and ultimately damage their business.**

Summer 2015.
My phone rang. Catching a glimpse of the ID, I saw “The Opener”. I had tried for 

weeks to get a hold of this guy. I didn’t know much about him. But, a business friend of 
mine said if I wanted to take launching gyms seriously, I should talk to the best. And “The 
Opener” was the best.

When big chains open a new store, they send their “all-star team”. Their best marketers, 
their best operators, their best product people, and so on. This ensures that when the store 
opens up, it makes an amazing first impression in that market. Right up my alley. And 
when the business establishes itself, the all-stars hire their replacements. Then, they rinse 
and repeat.

Section C: Advanced Offer Stacking

“The Opener” opened gyms for a billion-dollar gym franchise. So I couldn’t wait to 
learn from him. We spoke for almost an hour. I learned a lot from him and this gold nugget 
topped it off: 

“We open every location with 400+ recurring members, or we don’t open,” he said. 
“You can’t be serious.”
“No man, for real. We crush grand openings.”
“What do you do?”
“We advertise a 14-day trial into a lifetime discount on their membership. But we only 

offer the lifetime discounts to the members who sign up before we open. We call it the 
‘founding member discount.’ And since the discount lasts for life, and there’s a short time to 
get it, a lot of people want it. So we open up packed.”

Woah. “How on earth do you stay profitable with lifetime discounts?”
“We know our numbers—after the 14-day trial 80% sign up. So if we get 500 trials, 400 

bill on day 15. We turn a profit in month one. Better yet, most of them stick because they 
don’t want to lose their lifetime discount. So they become lifetime customers.”

It made too much sense. Not only was this a strong attraction offer, it also got people to 
stick for the long term. He had just given me a billion dollar secret. 

Description

Lifetime Discount offers, at least the way I use them, give customers a cheaper price 
as long as they stay on recurring payments. Customers get incentivized to take the offer now 
because they get value at a discount now. And with the way I use Lifetime Discounts, 
customers also stick because if they leave, they can’t get it back. 

 To make Lifetime Discounts even more attractive, add urgency (limited time), scarcity 
(limited number) and believable reasons for both (ex: grand opening). 

If you add these components, the Lifetime Discounts work like magic. Just offer to 
discount somebody’s monthly rate so long as they pay it. Make it more attractive by limiting 
the number of buyers or the amount of time they buy it. There you have it. (To learn more 
about urgency and scarcity refer to the Urgency and Scarcity Chapters in $100M Offers).

A Lifetime Discount only works if you actually charge more when this offer ends. 
Otherwise you just list the price and “pretend” it’s a discount. Gross.

Continuity Offer: Lifetime Discounts

The Opener used Lifetime Discounts as an attraction offer. I prefer to use them as upsells. 
I let people keep a “Rollover Upsell” discount only if they finish out the credited payments. 
This gets them to buy and gets them to stick. Think of it like “price protection” where you 
keep it so long as you keep paying for it.  

Final point: when giving Lifetime Discounts or any other discount, make sure you make 
a profit after the discount.

Important Notes

Lifetime Discounts come with a big fat warning: know your numbers. Lifetime 
Discounts work pretty good. So if you don’t know your numbers, you can get into serious 
trouble. This offer gives customers a locked-in discount so long as they pay. So remember, 
the cost of getting customers and the cost of delivering will change. If those costs get higher 
than your profit, and they have a locked-in rate, you’ve got problems. 

Three ways to display your lifetime discount. You can offer a percentage off retail 
(50% off), a dollar amount off retail ($20 off), or a fixed price (price protection). The first 
two are far more flexible. If things change (they always do), you can adjust your retail price 
and lifetime discount customers still keep their discount. So if you decide to offer a fixed price 
for life—know your numbers. 

Limit price protection for fixed periods. I try to always give myself flexibility. Giving 
one price forever limits me. To reconcile that, I offer price protection for a period of time 
rather than forever.

Ex: Normally $50/mo but you can pay $20/mo for the next 36 months. 
Never waste a crisis. Lifetime discounts are almost too good to be true. So you need an 

equally strong reason to make it seem believable. The best ones are real and true life events. 
Just as much as you can give a discount because something good happened, you can give a

Continuity Offer: Lifetime Discounts

discount because something bad happened. Here are a few of my favorite reasons why: We 
have surprise costs (leak, tax bill, legal, negative life events, etc.), my birthday, anniversary, 
holiday, founders discount, damaged goods, beta testers, spoil our local community, new 
program, new flavors/sizes/formula, you’re only limited by your creativity and the bad (or 
good things) that happen to you. 

If you say you will only offer this discount once and never again, stay true to it. To 
keep flexibility, you can always change what is included in your offer so that you can still sell 
at this “rate” again, just don’t sell the same thing you made available for “one-time only”—
twice. To be clear, businesses test price points all the time. You just want to make sure you 
do not offer two different prices to two different people at the same time for the same thing. 

You can offer a Lifetime Discount on one thing so long as they buy another at retail. 
If you have two or more services that are complementary, consider giving one at a steep 
forever founder’s discount and make up the profit on the other. Fancy business people call 
this a “loss leader”. For example, you could give an insane founder deal on “meal planning’” 
to attract boatloads of new customers…provided they pay retail for “meal prep services”. In 
other words, you can use insane founder’s discounts to attract leads then make your profits 
on the upsell. This often works better than two mid-priced offers or a generic 25% off the 
top of both. 

If a customer wants to leave the program, remind them they’ll lose the discount. 
This will save some customers from leaving. 

If a customer wants to return after canceling a Lifetime Discount. First, don’t give it 
back to them or you will lose credibility with everyone else. Second, offer them a downsell 
that meets the same price but has different features. I’ve found this to work best for people 
who are price sensitive. 

The Bigger The Head, The Longer The Tail

Bonus: The upsell comes built in. As soon as they like the product, make the original 
offer again. If they pay the difference of their down payment, they can lock in lower monthly 
payments. You can also offer to lock in this lower rate for life.“If you put down $XXX we’ll let 
you permanently buy down your monthly rate to $X, and keep it for life.” This helps get more 
cash and a stickier customer. 

When I was being mentored by John, the tanning empire king, he used to joke, “I just 
want $1 from everyone in the world.” He had built a massive low-price monthly recurring

tanning chain in Southern California. He taught me a lot about the subscription revenue 
business. I’m very grateful for the wisdom he would share over our long car rides. One of the 
biggest lessons I learned came when he was explaining how initiation fees worked. I didn’t 
even know they were “a thing”. 

“So guess which membership has the longest stick rate?” John asked, to lay context for 
his explanation of initiation fees.

“The cheapest one?” I guessed, waiting to hear the answer. 
“The one where they pay the most up front,” he replied, grinning sheepishly. 
I didn’t understand. He could tell I didn’t get it and continued, “If I get someone to pay 

$100 to sign up, and lower their rate from $18 to $10/mo, I’m never losing that person. 
They’ll even call me before their card changes to make sure they get to keep that lower rate. 
So they basically ‘buy’ a lower rate, but by doing that, they extend how long they stay by a 
ton. The more you can get people to commit up front the longer they’ll stick.” 

Being a little slow on the uptake, the thought that the bigger the head, the longer the tail 
came to my mind, and I wrote a note in my phone for later so I wouldn’t forget. That’s when 
I learned the power of initiation fees for continuity.

Another way to spin this same concept is to waive a hefty initiation fee if they commit 
to a longer duration of time. An example would be saying, “You have two options: you can 
either pay $100 today, then go into month-to-month at $10/mo, cancel whenever you like, 
or you can start today for $10 and commit to the year. If you commit to the year, I’ll waive 
the $100 initiation fee.”

This may seem to fly in the face of the above point because you think everyone would 
just take the lower fee and save the $100…but wait. If they for some reason try, and then 
cancel before the duration of their contract, you say, “Absolutely, no problem. All we have 
to do is switch you over to the month-to-month plan. Just cover the initiation fee of $100 
that we waived, and we’ll get you switched right over.” So by having this bigger “head,” you 
get a longer stick on the back end as many will choose to just finish out their contract than 
pay the steep fee. 

The reason getting people to pay more up front gets them to stay longer is a psychological 
phenomenon called the “Sunk Cost Fallacy”. Basically, people will disproportionately 
continue to invest in a choice in which they’ve already invested time or money, even if it 
no longer makes sense. You hear it in statements like, “we’ve already come this far,” “we’ve 
already put in so much time,” and “we might as well just finish it.”

Continuity Offer: Lifetime Discounts

This psychological principle is dangerous. If you don’t recognize it in yourself, you 
will expose yourself to far more risk than you otherwise should, and you will stick with 
things longer than you would otherwise (simply because you already have). This goes for 
partnerships, memberships, investments, gambling, and so much more. 

So getting more up front capitalizes on this psychological bias. But initiation fees don’t 
just work on one bias, they work on multiple. Let me give you a different example.

The Greater Up Front Payments Compared To The Scheduled Payments, The More 
Likely The Customer Will Complete Them. If I get paid $1,000 today then have five 
monthly payments of $100, I’ll likely collect the next five payments. On the other hand, if 
I ask for $100 per month for five months, and $1,000 at the end, the likelihood that the 
last payment goes through is lower. We account for this risk by adding more to the up front 
payment, creating a paid in full discount, or increasing the cost of ending their discount and 
reminding them of the cash they’ll forfeit (the up front payment) and the price they’ll lose 
(it’ll be more expensive if you come back). We want to remind them of these things as close 
to the purchase or cancel as possible.

Summary Points

Know your numbers. Preserve your margins. Deliver a killer product. If you can do this, 
then lifetime discount customers will flock to your door and scale your business at a profit. 

ʶ	 Lifetime Discounts lead to stickier customers because they lose the discount if they 
stop.  

ʶ	 Lifetime Discount offers makes a product or service cheaper for a customer as long 
as they stay on recurring payments. 

ʶ	 Add urgency and scarcity to make the Lifetime Discount offer (or any offer!) more 
compelling.

ʶ	 Use life events (both negative and positive) as reasons to offer a Lifetime Discount. 
ʶ	 If you offer a Lifetime Discount then you have a higher retail price. 
ʶ	 You can offer Lifetime Discounts in three ways: (%) off retail, ($) off retail, and fixed 

price. 
ʶ	 Make sure you have a healthy LTGP after the discount. 
ʶ	 This offer builds word of mouth because insane deals on great products get around 

fast.

Continuity Of﻿fer: Discount + One-Time Fee

Spring 2015.
I was walking out the front door of my La Habra location. The sun baked the black 

asphalt of the empty parking lot. It was midday, before the afternoon rush would begin in a 
few hours. Before I could take a step towards my car, a man quickly approached me, almost 
out of nowhere. 

“Hey are you the owner?”
I was a bit startled, but said, “Yeah.”

Before I could ask what he wanted, he ploughed right into his pitch.
“My name is Owen. I’m a personal training manager of a gym that just went under 

across town. I’ve got a group of trainers that just want to sell PT packages. We do about 
$100,000 per month in personal training sales. We just need a facility to work out of.”

“We don’t really offer personal training here,” I said, half-lying because I didn’t like the 
guy’s vibe. He didn’t seem trustworthy. I started to turn my side to him to show I wasn’t 
interested and began to make my way towards my car. 

He realized he needed to change his approach. “I promise we’re a self-sufficient team. I 
can see through the window that you guys have a lot of dead space even when your sessions 
are going on. We can just help you monetize that area. It’ll cost you nothing. It’s just upside.”

“It’ll cost me time and attention,” I countered, “and most importantly, it’ll cost me the 
goodwill I’ve accrued with my customer base.”

“No no no. We won’t even talk to your customers if you don’t want us to. We’ll go get 
our own leads and sell them. We just ask that you give them a discounted month up front. 
And we charge an enrollment fee, which I just give to my guy as commission for the sale. 
Whatever they can close for the fee is theirs. That’s how we do it. It’ll cost you nothing.”

“I’ll think it over.”
After thinking it over, I decided I did not want a foreign group of trainers and salespeople 

that I hadn’t vetted walking around my gym representing my company. But I did notice the 
offer structure he presented. A discount plus a fee. He had clearly seen success with it, that 
much I believed. And this was the first I’d heard of this monetization structure. It both 
attracted customers with the discount and liquidated commissions and acquisition costs 
through the fee.

Here’s how it works.

Description

You charge a discounted rate for your first term or period of service. You then charge one 
or more additional fees that you have “made up,” just like the Free with Fee structure. You 
can waive some and charge others, waive them all, or charge them all. It gives you a lot of 
offer flexibility, depending on the strength of the salesperson. This offer will tend to surprise 
fewer people since they already came in expecting to pay something, which is one of the key 
benefits of using Discounts over Free.

Continuity Offer: Discount + One-Time Fee

Examples

Any Recurring Service

Offer: 95% off First Month / $1,900 off First Month / First Month for $100
Monetization: They come in for the first month for $100, but still get charged a $1,900 setup 
fee. All in all, they get charged $2,000 and go straight into recurring. From a monetization 
perspective, they just got charged $2,000 their first month and each month thereafter. 

Any Defined-End Service or Program

Offer: 88% First Month (Selling a 12 Week Program for $3,000)
Monetization: You say it costs $1,000/mo for three months, but you get 88% off your first 
month ($120) and we have a $1,000 setup fee. They end up paying $1,120 for their first 
month then continuing their next two payments of $1,000 each.

Details

The higher the one-time startup fee, the lower the churn. The higher the barrier to entry, 
so too becomes the higher the barrier to exit. 

John told me that when his tanning empire had a $100 sign-up fee for a $10/mo 
membership price, the churn on those clients was next to nothing, whereas the clients who 
signed up for $19 down and $19/mo churned at a higher rate.

This means you can use these “made up fees” we’ve been talking about to actively decrease 
your churn and increase the investment of your prospects. This helps them and you in the 
long run. Everyone wins. When people pay, they pay attention. 

This is especially important for services where you require something to be done by the 
customer—getting you information, filling out forms, showing up at certain times, making 
selections, changing behavior, etc. If you need someone to do something in order to be 
successful, then more times than not, it makes sense to charge a one-time startup fee of 
some kind to get them invested in the long run. 

You can even have a massive disparity between setup and recurring fee. A good friend of 
mine who runs a multi-million dollar online weight loss coaching business charges $5,000 
to start and only $267/mo thereafter. His average client lifespan is more than two years

(compare that with the normal average fitness client who stays four months). This large up 
front sum gets the client invested in the process and makes leaving almost insane. 

And you guessed it. If they leave and want to come back, they have to pay it again. So 
this keeps people committed, especially when they have to do part of the work to achieve 
the result you sold them on (whatever that may be). 

Note: Be clear about what the “reason” for the one-time fee is (even though it’s made 
up). This should not be a fee taken lightly. It’s also something that you should bring up with 
any and every customer. You are doing the work, so you might as well let them know exactly 
what you are going to be doing for them. 

So here are the four steps to creating your one-time fee(s):
1)	 Pick Your Fee Name
2)	 Pick Your Fee Price
3)	 Pick Your “Reason Why”
4)	 Start Charging It, Discounting It, Or Waiving It

Summary Points

This play is incredibly flexible. You can use it in almost any type of business. The big 
discount can attract a lot of interest. These fees will help you offset the acquisition costs of 
marketing and sales. It also works very well with recurring or defined-end programs. And, 
in general, the larger the one-time fee up front, the higher the stick rate. Not only does this 
help you make money on the front end, it can dramatically enhance the lifetime value of 
the customer. These fees are also really good to think through, even if you don’t plan on 
using this monetization structure, as they can provide additional revenue streams for your 
business. There are lots of things you’re doing as a business owner, you might as well get 
credit for it. Waiving made-up fees can also help you generate more goodwill than signing 
someone up. You can also leave these fees to the discretion of the salesperson to help them 
“sweeten” the deal for someone on the edge. Unlimited uses here.

SECTION D: EXPANDED 
EMPLOYEES CHAPTER

“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together” - African Proverb

Lost Chapter Author Note: **Obviously there is an employee chapter in my $100M 
Leads book. I ended up cutting over half of it because I thought the chapter got too long 

and it started to creep into operations. But, enjoy the frameworks inside. They’ve been useful 
for me to transfer skills to teammates which is what you need to ultimately scale.**

June 2021.
The new sales director piped up, “I know we came in under our goal again, but I don’t 

think we need to change anything, we’ll hit it this quarter.” 
Eyes darted around the room and looked in every direction but mine. The silence was 

long enough for the executive assistant to mark the topic covered and move on. No wonder 
we missed our cold outreach goal for the second quarter in a row…nobody challenged the 
failure. What, so now we think the third time’s a charm? 

“Wait.” I said. Now everyone looked in my direction. “I’d like to know why we didn’t hit 
this two quarters in a row. I know we can sell—so if we want to make more sales with cold 
outreach, then we do more cold outreach. What’s the issue?” 

“We lose a rep every four weeks,” the sales director said. Aha.
“Ok…Why is our churn so high?” 
 “I was wondering the same thing, but HR says we’re actually below industry average 

churn for this position.” He continued, “But, by the time we hire and onboard one, another 
churns out.” 

I saw the HR Director nodding in agreement. Getting warmer.
“OK, so the issue is hiring,” I said. “So, what’s the hiring situation look like?” 
“We hire one out of every four candidates HR pushes to us.” 
“So if they churn out as fast as we hire them, and you only hire one out of every four, 

that means you only get like one candidate a week?” 
“Yeah, about that.” Almost there.

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

“Gotcha.” Now I looked at the HR Director. “What’s the screening situation look like?” 
“We get one qualified candidate per ten screening interviews, give or take,” she said. 
“So it takes forty interviews to get a single, low-skill, frontline worker?” 
“I guess so.” Bingo. 
“Alright, we need to change things up.” I said. “We’re bottlenecked at the one-on-one 

screening. Start interviewing in groups and look for crazies there. Push everyone else with 
a good work ethic and basic social skills over to sales. We can teach the rest. Agreed?” The 
team nodded.

Within six weeks, hiring outpaced churn. Our cold outreach sales increased in lockstep. 
By the end of the quarter, cold outreach sales had doubled, and made up more than half our 
total sales.

The issue wasn’t our cold outreach method, skills, or offer at all. We just didn’t have 
enough people doing cold outreach.

If you use the methods described in $100M Leads, you will see more engaged leads flow 
into your business. More engaged leads means more customers. But as you grow, so does 
your workload. In due time, it will take more work than any single person can handle. And 
you can solve the problem of too much work for one person by having more people work. 
In short, to advertise more, you’ll need more workers. And this chapter will show you how 
employees work, why they make you wealthy, how to get them, and the method I use to 
turn them into lead-getters. 

How Employees Work

Lead-getting employees are people working in your business that you train to get you 
leads. They get you leads the exact same way you got your own leads in the beginning. They 
can run ads, they can make and post content, and they can do outreach. They can do any 
advertising you train them to do. So more lead-getting employees means more engaged leads 
for your business. It also means less work you have to do to get the leads. More leads and less 
work? Sign me up! But wait… Not so fast…

Don’t get me wrong—employees take work. They just take less time and work than doing 
everything on your own. In my experience, if you trade forty hours of doing for four hours

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

of managing, you work thirty-six hours less. Brilliant. And the best part is, you can make 
that trade over and over. You can swap 200 hours of work per week for twenty hours of 
management. Then, you trade the twenty hours of managing for a manager, who costs 
you four hours per week to lead. What remains is four hours of work for 200 hours of 
lead-getting. Boom.

Bottom Line: Employees make a fully functioning enterprise that grows without you.

Why Employees Make You Wealthy

For your business to run without you, other people need to run it. 

Scenario #1: Imagine you have a business that makes $5,000,000 per year in revenue 
and $2,000,000 in profit. And, to make that profit, you have to work around the clock. In 
this situation, you basically have a high-paying job. But let’s say you’re OK with working all 
hours and knowing your business would burn down if you took a vacation. Vacations are for 
losers anyways (kidding *cough* sort of…). We still have another important thing to look 
at… 

Sure, you make a bit of money, but your business isn’t worth much. If the business only 
makes money with you in it, then it’s a bad investment for anyone else. That may not sound 
like a big deal right now, but let’s consider an alternative. 

Scenario #2: Your business makes the same $5,000,000 in revenue and $2,000,000 in 
profit. But there’s one big difference: The business runs without you. This does two very cool 
things. One, it turns what used to be a risky job into a valuable asset. And two, it makes you 
much wealthier. Here’s how:

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

First, you get your time back, so you can use that time to invest in your business, buy 
other businesses, or take your stinkin’ vacations. Second, you become much wealthier 
because your business is now worth something to someone else. You turned a liability that 
relied on you into an asset you can rely on. 

If you have an asset that makes millions of dollars without you then that means somebody 
else could use it to make millions of dollars without them. In other words, your business is 
now a good investment. Then investors looking for assets, like Acquisition.com for instance, 
would buy some or all of it from you. And your $2,000,000 in profit per year, especially if 
it’s climbing, could easily be worth $10,000,000+, right now. So your business went from 
having almost zero value to having $10,000,000 of value. 

You get rich from what you make. You become wealthy from what you own. And it took me 
years to realize this because not that long ago…

Everything I Thought I Knew About Employees Was Wrong

Have you ever heard…
If you want it done right, you gotta do it yourself.
No one can do it like I do it.  
Nobody can replace me. 

I have. I said all that stuff. I lived all that stuff. For years, every time I hired somebody, 
I would compare what they could do to what I could do. In my head, I felt like it was “me 
against them”. To somehow prove I was the more “able” one. With my own team! And this 
belief, this way of “leading” people, never made me more money.

For business—“nobody can do it but me” and “if you want something done right you 
gotta do it yourself ” aren’t facts…they’re false. Somebody did similar stuff before you were 
around. And somebody will continue doing some version of it after you’re gone. In one way 
or another, everyone is replaceable. It might be by multiple people, technology, or later in 
time, but everyone can be replaced. My suggestion: replace yourself as soon as you can. Then, 
you can make yourself useful somewhere else. Many other people figured this out. And so 
can you. 

In the early days, whenever I started a business, I could do stuff better than the people I 
hired. My entire workforce always ended up looking like a ragtag group of misfits who could 
kind of do one of the many things I could do. This got me up and running at first, but I fell 
into the trap of believing I was better than everyone else. I would go back and forth between 

132 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

gloating because I was better than them and complaining because they weren’t as good as 
me. And for whatever reason, it never occurred to me I was the one who hired and trained 
them. Who was I kidding? The reality was twofold: First, I didn’t have the skills to train or 
lead a team properly. Second, I was too poor, and then (when I had a little money) too cheap 
to hire anyone better. In other words, it was my fault they sucked. Oops. 

The more I tried to outcompete my employees, the more distracted I became, and the 
worse my business got. Sure, maybe I could do anything better than any of my employees. 
But… I couldn’t do everything better than all my employees. And when I finally realized 
this, I started adopting better beliefs about talent:

If you want it done right, get someone to spend all their time doing it.
If I can do it, someone else can do it better.
Everyone is replaceable, especially me.

These new beliefs about talent not only made a much healthier culture in my businesses 
but also came with very profitable side effects. Trusting my employees to succeed made my 
time and attention far more valuable. If somebody else can do it, why would I? If somebody 
else could train them, why would I? If I could learn other stuff to grow the business while 
my team held the fort down, it made way more sense to do that. So let’s do that.

How Getting Employees Works: The Five Lead Stages

There are five stages a lead goes through before becoming a customer. Each lead stage is 
a reaction to something your business does. This means the way you run your business turns 
leads into customers or not. And this is good. Better yours than someone else’s! 

The lead stages are self-explanatory: 

Uncontacted → Contacted → Engaged → Qualified → Sold

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 133



Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

Let’s walk through each: 
1)	 Leads start out uncontacted. You have done nothing they can react to yet. 

Action: You advertise to them. 
2)	 Leads go from uncontacted to contacted when you get their attention.

Next Action: You incentivize them to engage with your lead magnet or offer. 
3)	 Leads go from contacted to engaged when they show interest in your lead magnet or 

offer. 
Next Action: You qualify them by learning their problems and money situation. 

4)	 Leads go from engaged to qualified if they have a problem you solve and money to 
solve it.

Next Action: You sell them by making an offer you’ll fulfill in exchange for 
money.  

5)	 Leads go from qualified to sold when they give you money in exchange for what you 
offer. 

If you’re wondering why I bring the lead stages up now, this far in, it’s because they 
have the most value now, this far in. Again, for years, I struggled to build good teams for my 
businesses. I would either hire anybody I could find and throw them to the wolves. Or, I 
would cross my fingers hoping one of my best customers would work for me. Sure, this got 
me (and will get you) off the ground. But it’s a far cry from what it takes to build a $100M 
Leads machine. When that finally sunk in, I realized something…

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

Getting new employees was the same as getting new customers. We just describe it with 
different words. This blew my mind when I stumbled on it. And once I looked at it this way, 
my hiring problems pretty much solved themselves. Let’s break it down together. 

Line up the actions to get employees with the actions to get customers and they fit like a glove. 
Think about it this way—you have two types of customers: The customers who pay you 

and the customers you pay—your employees. 
And the reason is this—humans are humans. The process of getting attention is the 

same. The process of helping make decisions is the same. I just used different words to describe 
the same thing. 

How To Get Them: The Internal Core Four

Remember the Core Four (warm outreach, cold outreach, paid ads, posting content) 
from $100M Leads? Well, they work for getting employees too. Imagine that. By changing 
the frame from “letting potential customers know about your stuff” to “letting potential 
employees know about your stuff” it immediately turns into something you already know 
how to do. But some people also have the opposite problem—they already know how to get 
employees just fine but still struggle to get customers. They are just people you let know about 
your stuff. You do the same thing!

It’s the same exact stuff! Isn’t that cool?

Customers → Employees

Warm Outreach→Asking Your Network Customer Referrals→Employee Referrals
Cold Outreach→ Recruiting Affiliates→ Associations, Guilds, Listservs etc. 
Post Content→Posting Job Openings Agencies→ Staffing firms, etc.
Paid Ads→Promoting Job Postings Employees→Employees (unchanged)

The ways you get employee leads and their lead getters have equivalents to the ways 
you get customer leads and their lead getters. So when you need to get new talent, you just 
advertise to get it. And when you need more, you do more. And like creating a reliable 
process to get customers, you can also create a reliable process of getting employees.

How To Get Employees To Get You Leads

Now you hire someone who costs you money every month. Great. Let’s make sure you 
make it back, and some ASAP. 

Note—some people looking for work will already know how to get leads. Those people 
are awesome. You can also count on them to cost more. And if you’re starting out, you may 
not be able to afford them. So, your next best option is to train them. Thankfully, you have 
an entire book of lead-getting at your fingertips ($100M Leads). So the next step is training 
your employees on how you do those lead-getting activities. I think about and actually 
approach training with this 3Ds mental model: Document, Demonstrate, Duplicate. Here’s 
how it works.

Step One—Document: You make a checklist. You already know how to do the thing. 
Now you just need to write down the steps exactly as you do it. You can also have other 
trusted observers watch you and document what you do. Bonus points if you record yourself 
doing the thing multiple ways and in multiple shifts. This way, you can watch yourself as an 
observer rather than breaking your flow by pausing to take notes while you go. Once you’ve 
got everything put into the checklist, bust it out on your next work block and only follow 
those steps. Can you do an A+ job only following your directions exactly? If you can, you 
have the first draft of your checklist for the job.

Step Two—Demonstrate: You do it in front of them. Just like the agency owner taught 
me how to run Facebook ads. You sit down and walk them through the checklist step by 
step. This may take a while depending on how many steps it takes to complete the thing. If 
they stop you, or slow you down, to understand something, adjust your checklist for that. 
Now you have the second draft ready for them to try. 

Step Three—Duplicate: They do it in front of you. Now it’s their turn. They follow the 
same checklist you followed. Except this time, they’re the one doing, and you’re the one 
observing. We just want them to duplicate what we did. So if the checklist is right, the 
outcome will be the same. And if the checklist is off—you’ll find out fast! Fix your checklist 
until it’s right. Then, have them follow it until they get it right. And once they nail it, you 
now have a bonafide lead-getter on your payroll. Congratulations!

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

After you train your first few employees this way, you’ll have worked out the kinks for 
that job and it’s pretty smooth sailing from there. (At least the training part anyways). Think 
about it this way, if you vanished tomorrow, could a stranger get the results you get if they 
only followed your checklist? That’s the level of clarity to shoot for.
Some helpful notes on training:

ʶ	 A helpful way to look at this training style is: If they get it wrong or get confused then 
we got it wrong or made it confusing. If we have to explain repeatedly what a step 
means then the step is too complicated. Or, more likely, we tried to put multiple 
steps into one. 

ʶ	 If they only appear to “get it” after a longish explanation or multiple demonstrations 
then, again, we’ve got some work to do. Business owners that ignore this run into 
chronic training problems. And, word to the wise, you can probably force an inferior 
checklist to work, but this turns into a nightmare when somebody else takes over 
your training for you.

ʶ	 There is a difference between competence and performance. In other words, they can 
know exactly what to do and not be that good at it yet. If that’s the case, then your 
instructions are fine and they just need practice. Using an analogy from the fitness 
world—think “slow then smooth then fast”.

ʶ	 Focus on your employee’s ability to follow directions more than whether they get the 
right result. This is super important because if you train your employees to follow 
directions then…they will follow directions. And, if they follow directions and get 
the wrong result…then you know it’s the directions. That’s good. You have a lot more 
control over that. 

ʶ	 Every time they do a step successfully—let them know they did it right. And if they 
respond to praise, praise them! And if they goof, that’s OK too. That’s what training 
is for. Don’t take over for them when they mess up—simply pause, take a step back, 
and let them try it again. Fast feedback cycles to get people to learn faster. 

ʶ	 If they follow your directions exactly and get the wrong result—still praise them for 
following the directions. Praise them, then make the corrections to your checklist 
on the spot. 

ʶ	 Avoid punishment or penalties of any type for doing stuff wrong during training. 
As a rule of thumb—reward the good stuff you want them to do more of and they’ll 
do more of it. Learning a new skill is punishing enough, we don’t need to add to it.

138 Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION



Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

ʶ	 If they mess up multiple steps, only focus on fixing one step at a time. Give one 
piece of feedback at a time. And remind them and give feedback on it until they get 
it right. Then move to the next step. It’s very hard to change multiple things at the 
same time when you’ve never done something before. 

Keep Your Employees Getting You Leads—The Performance Diamond

They do it on their own, with frequent check-ins.

Now that they know how to do it, we have to keep them doing it. Here’s how. Depending 
on the business, I or my managers meet with each lead-getting employee six to 11 times per 
week. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it’s really not. 

I schedule one 30 to 45 minute meeting per week for coaching, feedback, and praising 
success. The other times are short group meetings that only last a few minutes. We call them 
“daily huddles”—and all my lead-getting employees have them. We have one at the beginning 
of each shift to discuss expectations and goals. Then, we have one at the end of each shift so 
they can report on them. I get an opportunity to praise and reward their efforts daily. This 
creates faster feedback cycles for building skills and morale. 

Copyright © 2025 by BUMBLE IP, LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 139



Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

If necessary, we take an extra few minutes to troubleshoot and answer questions that 
came up during the shift. If these problems or questions keep coming up, I add those to 
my training checklist for the next person I hire. Over time, you can have a team leader or 
manager take over the huddles and, eventually, the one-on-ones. Provided their performance 
stays the same or improves, you’ve successfully integrated the skill. You made it so they can 
feed their family for the rest of their lives. I know of few (if any) more noble callings. 

Troubleshooting: What to do if they stop doing a good job? In my experience, there are 
four reasons employee performance drops. Here’s how we solve for them. 
1)	 Communication—Employees don’t know THAT we want them to do it. If an 

employee didn’t know we wanted them to do something then we didn’t communicate 
that we wanted it done properly. Even if we think we did, their performance shows 
otherwise. 
Keep in mind—once we learn a skill, we need to be reminded more than we need to be 
taught. Remember, you are the chief accountability officer in the beginning and always. 
Afterall, it’s your business—you are always accountable. So really, the only thing that 
changes is who you remind to do what. Even if it means you remind somebody to do 
their reminding! 
Here’s what it sounds like when you have a communication problem:
“I didn’t know you wanted me to do that.”
“I didn’t know you wanted me to do that first.”
“I’ve got too much work on my plate right now.” 
 Don’t blow this off. It’s so easy to point the finger and say “How can you not know your 
own job!?” But my business improved a lot when I actually believed them and started 
to point the finger at myself. So if I ever have this problem, I have them summarize the 
where, when, and how much they’re supposed to perform their tasks. In essence, I have 
them describe their job and priorities back to me. If we think different stuff, then I 
know I need to do a better job at making things clear. 
And you may be surprised—they may still be working on that top priority thing you 
asked them to do a…few hours earlier (ha).

2)	 Training—Employees don’t know HOW to do it. Assuming employees know that 
you want them to do it, they forgot how or were never taught! We account for this with 
strong initial training (onboarding) and regular practice of the basics to maintain and 
improve competence (daily huddles).

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

Here’s what a training problem sounds like:
“I don’t know how to do that.”
“I didn’t know you wanted me to do it that way.”

Similar to number one—don’t blow this off. Again, it’s easy to point a finger and say “I 
already taught you how to do this! Seriously?”—But really…did we? How do we really 
know that? 
Often, we think we taught somebody something if we ask “do you understand this?” 
and they say “yes”. But even more often they are just conditioned to say “yes” out of fear of 
saying “no”. So, instead of asking if they understand and then holding it against them 
later—just have them show you. Let them demonstrate the checklist like they did in 
training. And treat them as you would anyone else learning for the first time, with 
patience, understanding, and fast useful feedback.

3)	 Motivation—Employees don’t WANT to do it. Assuming they know that you want 
them to do it, and how to do it, they might not want to do it. And people don’t want to 
do things for three main reasons:

ˏ	 “Reward” comes at: the wrong time, wrong frequency, wrong intensity, or the 
wrong source

ˏ	 They have an aversion to: the work itself, environment, leadership, coworkers, 
consumers 

ˏ	 They have events or other lifestyle stuff outside work killing their performance  
i)	 Positive Event Example: Newborn baby, wedding 

ii)	 Negative Event Example: Death in family, break-up/divorce
iii)	 Lifestyle Examples: Not sleeping enough, too much alcohol, getting sick, 

other medical conditions
Solving it comes from asking questions with these three levers in mind. Are you not 
rewarding them correctly? If so—increase frequency, intensity, or change who is doing 
the rewarding. Is there something about the workplace that makes it demotivating? 
This can give us insights to more systemic issues. Or, often, is there something we can 
only discover by asking them what’s eating their attention outside of work? So, we 
ask open-ended questions to see what they’ll share. Beyond having a genuine heart to 
help, sometimes you just gotta let people figure out their own stuff on their dime rather 
than yours.

Pro Tip: The Best Diamond Hard Feedback Question 

If an employee’s performance has been dropping for a little while (a week or 
two), here’s a line I stole from Leila (like most of my good ideas). Use it in your 
next weekly one-on-one:

 “Over the last (length of time) your (task performance) has changed from the norm. 

  What do you think has gotten in the way and how can I help?” 

This question sets the stage for a collaborative problem-solving conversation 
rather than a character-blaming one. Swipe it if you like it. 

4)	 Circumstances—Something is stopping them. I feel like I need to give you rapid 
examples of this. Unfortunately, this is more common than you think. In short—
business owners (me included) tend to expect employees to solve problems we should 
have prevented to begin with! 

ˏ	 “Go grill the burgers”→ “I can’t. We’re out of beef.”
ˏ	 “Go edit videos”→ “I can’t. My internet is too slow to download the file.”
ˏ	 “Go make calls”→ “I can’t. The phone broke.”

Understand the difference between them “making excuses” and making their life 
legitimately difficult. Assuming good communication, training, and motivation—all 
three of the above, something is stopping them. These are some of the easiest to fix, but 
you have to ask to find out. And as silly as what they’re gonna say may sound—don’t 
shoot the messenger. 

This is the performance diamond I use for diagnosing performance problems. If I 
approach performance with that perspective it goes a long way to figuring out whether it’s 
truly the employee’s problem or, more often, something I messed up along the way. I say this 
because, most times, both you and them want them to succeed. So once you figure out what 
the problem is, fix it—and improved performance will likely follow. 

Now we know how to get them and keep them advertising, the question that remains is, 
how well are we doing?

How to Calculate Returns From Lead-Getting Employees 

Excluding the cost of running paid ads, the cost of advertising (outreach, content, etc.) 
with employees is almost entirely based on the amount of money you pay them to do it. We 
simplify this by just comparing how much money we spend on payroll to how much money 
the engaged leads they get bring in: 

ʶ	 Total Payroll / Total Engaged Leads = Cost per engaged lead. 
ˏ	 Ex: $100,000 / 1,000 leads = $100 per engaged lead

ʶ	 If one out of 10 of the engaged leads become customers then our CAC is $1,000
ˏ	 ($100 per engaged lead) x (10 engaged leads per customer) = $1,000 

CAC
ʶ	 If each customer has an LTGP of $4,000 then you have an LTGP : CAC of 4:1

ˏ	 ($4,000 LTGP) / ($1,000 CAC) = 4:1
For example: at the time of this writing, I get about 30,000 engaged leads per month 

at Acquistion.com. I run no paid ads, and do no outreach. But the team responsible for 
creating the content that generates that interest is about $100,000 per month. This means, 
it costs me roughly $3.33 per engaged lead ($100,000 / 30,000 leads) in payroll to generate 
them. We make much more than $3.33 per lead, so we’re profitable. You can apply the same 
math to whatever advertising method you use. 

How To Know Which Employees To Focus On To Maximize Returns
Like we learned in the Run Paid Ads Part II Chapter of $100M Leads—if your cost to 

get a customer is within 3x industry average then you’re doing good enough. From there, you 
focus on bumping up your LTGP. 

If your CAC is more than 3x industry average then you have a sales problem or an 
advertising problem. We diagnose this with a single question: 

 Do my engaged leads have the problem I solve and the money to spend?
ʶ	 If no, then they’re not qualified—that’s an advertising problem. 
ʶ	 If yes, then they’re qualified and:

ˏ	 They’re buying but you don’t have enough of them—advertising problem 
ˏ	 They’re qualified but not buying—sales problem.

Section D: Expanded Employees Chapter

Don’t fire your sales guy if you’ve got advertising problems. And equally, don’t fire your 
advertising employees if you’ve got a sales problem. That little question can help you identify 
which employees to focus on. 

But fundamentally, you just need to figure out all your costs of getting a customer put 
together. And as long as they’re at least one third of the profit you make over the lifetime, 
you’re in good shape.

Conclusion

The goal of this chapter was to shift your perspective. It’s your job to advertise and sell the 
vision of your company. You advertise it publicly and privately to employees and customers 
alike. That’s the job. And once you get good at it, you become unstoppable. 

I say this because I believe anyone can be taught to do “ground level” jobs for any 
business—advertising or otherwise. So who you pick is not as important as how you train 
the ones you do.

Like I’ve said throughout the book and will say again here—it doesn’t take a genius to 
advertise. I’d even say it hurts it. We’ve got plenty more iron-wills than brainiacs anyways. 
Remember, this isn’t about brains, it’s about guts. And although some people might be born 
geniuses, nobody is born with an iron will (afterall, we all come out crybabies). All this to 
say, having guts is a skill. And that means anyone can have the guts if they learn how. So if 
you have an iron will, and as an entrepreneur you probably do, it won’t take long for you to 
figure out that you got it from your life experiences. You can pass those experiences on as 
lessons to anyone who cares enough to listen. Then, they can stand on your shoulders and 
have a better chance at succeeding in life.

And—you can’t really know anything anyway until you train them well and give 
them a fighting chance to succeed out in the field. Plus, for low-level jobs, you’ll never 
have a shortage of labor. Get picky when you have to make massive investments in 
hyper-specific-multiple-six-figure-C-suite employees. Aka—“fancy employees”. 

I find at this current stage, it’s actually a better use of time to hire and train anyone 
willing. Then, when you find winners, and with this method you will: treat them well, don’t 
burn them out, and give them what they deserve.

In the land of overflowing leads, you’ll need allies. Employees are among the most 
powerful of these allies. We talked about: how they make you wealthy, how they work, how 
getting them works, how to get them, how to get them getting you leads, how to keep them 
getting you leads, and how to know you’re doing a good job. And once you’ve built a system 
for getting people who get you leads (doing the Core Four on your behalf ), you just need to 
do more.

How to turn time into money.

Lost Chapter Author Note**: Time is the only resource we’re given. The people who make the 
most money know how to trade it for the highest return. I wrote this on how I run my time. It’s 
ruthlessly simple. It’s also how we run the teams at Acquisition.com. And if you spend time, or 

manage people who do, this may be one of the most important things you ever read. Also, special 
thanks to Paul Graham who wrote about this concept 14 years ago. I borrowed the title in ode 

to it, and to expand upon it given my personal experience. 

A conversation happening everywhere around the world…
“You got time tomorrow morning?”
I look over to my empty calendar. I suppose I could fit it in. But I was planning on taking a big 
chunk out of this project. 
“Uhh, yea I have some openings. How long you thinking?”
“Shouldn’t take longer than an hour…say 10am?”

“Hey, I’m reaching out because John introduced us. Wanna grab a coffee sometime this 
week?”
I didn’t think I needed anything at the moment. But I don’t want to be rude.
“Yea, I think I can make time.”
“Cool. Here’s a great spot. ADDRESS. I’ll meet you there, say 2pm?”
“Yea, that works. See you then.”

The Two Types of Calendars

Both of these examples represent hundreds of millions of exchanges that happen every 
day. What you don’t see is that to one person, this type of exchange costs ten times more 
than the other. Let me explain. 

There are two very different ways to manage time for two very different types of work 
and workers. There are makers. And there are managers. I’ll start with the one that most 
people are familiar with—managers—because this is how most of the world manages time… 

Managers

Managers divide their time into small 30–60 minute blocks. This gives them between 
10 to 20 chunks of work time per day. And each block often differs from the block before. 

Their work often depends on meetings where they direct others. They collect data and 
report data to persuade, lead, train, encourage, and make other decisions. They talk to lots 
of different people and do many different kinds of tasks all day long. They have a pretty 
clear beginning and end to their work day. They basically work until their last calendar slot 
appointment. 

For managers, an empty time slot is a lost opportunity. For that reason, they treat time 
like currency. And an empty time slot means “free” to fill with manager stuff. The only real 
cost for them to fill it is to coordinate with another person’s empty time slot. On paper, since 
they “work” on meetings, a mutually filled slot makes both people more productive.

Their objective is to use up all the chunks in their day so they can maximize their time. 
Fair enough.

Makers, on the other hand, make up a much smaller number of workers (and shrinking!). 
They actually make stuff. And, they cannot “make” in small 30–60 minute blocks of time. 
And depending on what they make, it takes very large chunks of time, half-day or full-day 
blocks. Therefore, they have fewer of them. They may only have one to two chunks of time 
per day. And maybe 10 to 14 per week. 

The work is often similar on the outside, especially day to day. For them, they have 
known work inputs (like keystrokes) but variable outputs (they often make something 
different every time). So seldom if ever do they have a task they can finish on any given 30-
minute block. Their days typically have a similar start time but variable finish. They work 
“open to goal”. In other words, they work until their quality output per unit time drops. 
Their performance decides when they’re done for the day. And compared to managers, they 
have a more limited time they can work until they mentally exhaust themselves. And on 
a larger time horizon, the best makers only switch tasks when the project they work on is 
finished. So their work has relatively low urgency compared to the swashbuckling manager, 
but, at the same time, it can have the highest importance. 

And, from the outside, a lot of their work may not look like work at all. An impressive 
percentage of the time doesn’t go into labor people see. It often goes into figuring out 
how to do the work people see. They don’t solve problems so they can work, solving is the 
work. They might get stuck for 45 minutes and then bang, it comes to them. Sometimes, 
problem-solving dry spells can last days. In my case, it took me upwards of six months just 
to figure out the table of contents for my second book. That is the maker’s work. It means 
doing things, producing what nobody has produced before. At least not by anyone they have 
access to. And it also means producing in ways maybe nobody has gone about producing it. 
Otherwise, they would make something else.  

Based on the immersive nature of their work, they incur a monumental cost of switching 
tasks. A meeting, even a short one, breaks the larger chunk into two smaller chunks, near 
unusable for maker’s work. A whole work unit—poof! For example, a 10am meeting, even 
for 30 minutes, breaks their morning block into 2 hours and 1.5 hours. Not enough to get 
back into their immersive, deep, flow-dependent maker’s work.

What’s worse, when they do have something on the schedule, they “suffer” from 
something called the Zeigarnik effect. The Zeigarnik effect states that you will tend to 
remember open loops better than closed loops. Normally, this is a good thing. Like managers 
for instance, it helps them remember the stuff they have to do during the day. But for a 
maker, it’s a mind-parasite. For them, the open loops and pending tasks eat up attention, 
disrupt immersion, and destroy a maker’s productivity. Even if you know something happens

in the afternoon, you know you must limit your morning work. You have to pay attention 
to make sure you end on time. Never mind the intrusive thoughts interrupting your day…
now you must also watch the clock at a regular interval which interrupts the work you do 
leading up to the meeting. And at some point, you begin to think about what needs to be 
covered in the meeting, wholly removing the maker from their project at hand. 

Makers get work done outside of meetings. To a maker, an empty calendar means full 
productivity. For makers, unless they have the luxury of working in a bomb shelter, it’s easier 
to work when other people don’t (early morning and late evening). This limits interruptions. 
But it also drastically inflates the amount of time they spend on their jobs (versus the time 
they spend working!). They “clock in” during the day, only to be interrupted all day, then 
finally start working when everyone else stops!

Their objective is to maximize the blank space on their calendar so they can have as 
many large uninterrupted chunks of time as possible.

The Problem

Makers and managers can both exist at the same time. Problems occur when they try to 
work together. When a manager tries to work with a maker, not knowing how makers work, 
it leads to productivity disasters. Since the relative time slot for the manager costs so little, 
and makes the manager more productive, they assume, and for good reason, it’s also true 
for the maker. “It’s just 30 minutes, and you’ve got the free time, what’s the big deal?” But 
it couldn’t be further from the truth. It costs makers 10x more. A short meeting costs one 
measly work unit for the manager…and a giant work unit for the maker.

What’s worse, if a manager asks a maker to block time, the maker has two terrible 
outcomes. First, they either offend the manager (and incur other risks) by declining 
the invitation. Oftentimes this damages the relationship or decreases the likelihood of 
collaboration in the future (which they may need). Or they accept, and take an unreasonably 
high cost for a meeting that often yields…nothing. 

Managers often assume that makers can work like they do, on demand. But this confuses 
the nature of managerial work and maker’s work. And given the fact most people work 
on manager’s schedules, it leads to huge losses in productivity and very late nights or early 
mornings for the maker who must accommodate everyone else’s schedules—mostly out of 
fear and politeness.

Maker or Manager?

This means managers often prevent the work they check in on! And when this happens 
(often), both parties lose. The manager takes a hit because the maker takes the hit. But this 
creates a trap. The worse the maker’s performance gets the more the manager tries to keep tabs 
on them! Lose-lose. 

Unfortunately, this is how most of the world works. But there is a better way... 

The Solution

We attack the problem on three fronts. To the manager, to the makers, and to the 
organization. 

To the managers: 
Step 1: Understand both costs you put on a maker. 

First, the cost of coordinating times while they work destroys their productivity. And 
once you have a time set aside, understand that the time itself eats up an entire work block. 
Know the difference between your work and a maker’s work. When you ask for a meeting, 
it costs them ten times more. You use up one of their 10 slots per week. I’m not telling you 
to not…meet your makers. Just that if you want your organization to be more productive, 
understand the costs of your requests. And when you make them, be sure it is worth it. 

Step 2: Understand the value of the maker’s “no”.
If a maker declines a meeting, do not take offense. See it as them trying to keep their 

larger commitment to you and others—to get the meaningful project done.   

To the makers: 
Step 1: Good managers WANT TO HELP YOU. Let them. 

Part of that responsibility lies on you to make managers aware of the differences between 
your work and schedules. Send this piece of content to them to help them help you. And yes, 
you will have to take meetings that eat your entire day sometimes. When that happens, fight 
fire with fire—swap to a manager’s calendar style. 

All makers have some administrative tasks to do. And since you’ve lost the chunk anyway, 
you can get some good feedback, serious wins, and other benefits by just dedicating the

entire chunk to as many meetings and other administrative tasks as you can. That way, you 
can save other time blocks in the future from being made unusable. 

Step 2: Make meeting blocks. And stick to them.
In addition, you can have standard “meeting” times where you accept these. And you 

must defend these. It’s rare that a meeting is truly urgent. See if you can push them off to the 
designated blocks you set aside ahead of time. Make this time available to anyone who meets 
with you on a regular basis, and to people who ask to meet spur of the moment. 

Since I’m an entrepreneur, I like to dedicate the first half of the day to doing maker’s 
work and then the second half for manager’s work. So people can meet with me pretty much 
every day…just after 1pm. Also, I schedule my meetings from back to front. This way, if 
somebody does get scheduled with me, it happens as late in the day as possible. This way, I 
can extend my maker’s block a little bit. And even though the Zeigarnik effect takes hold, I 
can still get a little more done than I otherwise would have. 

Pro Tip: How To Apply This As A Freelancer or Solopreneur

No one works on your calendar and you don’t have anyone on your team to 
block for you. Expect no one to know how you work or why. When I had 
fewer means, I worked from 4am to 10am on my “maker” work, then tended to 
the usual fires of business during the day. This gave me nine work blocks. One 
per day during the week and two chunks each weekend day. You may have to 
adopt a schedule like this. With your real work happening before or after “the 
managers,” interruptions cease. This got me through the early years. Beyond 
sharing this piece of content with everyone you work with, it may be a good 
in-between measure. 

Step 3: Set expectations for slow responses during your maker’s block. 
People have an amazing ability to adapt if you tell them ahead of time. People really only 

get upset when you don’t meet expectations. So—change them! Let everyone know this is 
how you work and this is when you will be responsive vs. not. 

Step 4: Work when you say you work.

Maker or Manager?

You only get to claim the title of “maker” if you make stuff. Otherwise, you’re a fool and 
you make a fool out of anyone who calls themselves a maker.

If you have the luxury of people who respect your schedule, you owe it to them to make! 
If you waste time, you will confirm all their suspicions. They will think you never worked 
to begin with! And you damage your reputation and the reputation of all other makers. You 
make it less likely they will respect your work and your word in the future. 

To the organizations: 
Step 1: Consider mandated “quiet” time chunks.

 During these, entire teams cannot message one another or meet. Either a chunk of time 
daily, or entire days of the week. It doesn’t need to apply to the entire organization, only 
the ones where you have makers. Engineers. Developers. Copywriters. Builders. Presenters. 
Media editors. Etc. 

Step 2: Spread this content to makers and managers alike so everyone can use the same 
language to describe this large source of waste…and prevent it!

My goal is to increase awareness of these two types of working styles and put words to 
something that plagued me for a long time. And hopefully, gives words to the makers out 
there, whose work moves the world. So that they can share this with the people who work 
with them, to hopefully explain how costly “got a min?” really is.

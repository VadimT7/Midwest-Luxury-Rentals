GOATed Ads

Winning Ads in Under 30 min.

Disclaimer: This is to be used on top of the paid ads chapters in $100M Leads. 
Not, instead of. This takes those ideas and puts them on steroids.

Summer 2020 - December 2021
“Why don’t you scale your ads?” I asked one of our portfolio founders.
“Every time we try, we hit a wall. We’ve just saturated this market.”
“Bro you sell weight loss on Facebook and spend $200,000 per month on ads.”
“Yea, but it’s the only thing that can explain it. After about 5-8k per day in ad spend, our 

cost to acquire customers shoots through the roof.”
“How often are you recording new ads?
“At least once a month.”
“Wait. You’re only making ads once a month?”
“Yea…at least!”
“How many new ads do you get?”
“At least five, sometimes a few more.”
“I figured out the problem.”
“What? Really?”
“Yeah, you’re gonna take at least five and change it to at least 500.” 
He looked too shocked to say much, so I kept going. 
“Okay, here’s the plan. You’re gonna devote every single Friday to advertising. First, find 

your best ads. Second, chop them into: hook, meat, CTA. Then we’ll run them through a 
kaleidoscope to make 50 more hooks and with it, generate 3-5 variations on the meat. If we 
do that, we’ll be making 150 ads per week. That means we’ll go from 5 ads a month to 600 
ads a month. ”

“That’s a ton…”
“Yeah, your business won’t get smaller.” I continued.
“You haven’t saturated Facebook. But you have gotten all the low hanging fruit. You’ve 

hit a wall with your ad quality, not with the market. The better your ads, the bigger the au-
dience they’ll convert.”

“Yea, I guess that makes sense.”
“Remember those Old Spice ads with the dude on the horse?”
“Yea those were great.”
“Right. I wasn’t an Old Spice buyer. I saw those ads and thought they were funny then 

started buying their stuff. And so did 70% of the market. That’s an ad that wasn’t capped. It 
was good enough to convert everyone. That’s how you make ads that scale - you make better 
ads. And you only do that by making more…way more.”

***

The company doubled in two quarters. It’s how we run ads for Acquisition.com, Skool.
com, and all of our other companies running paid ads.

And this isn’t some fancy idea that might work. This process took me 13 years to devel-
op. Simply put, it works.

Outline

This playbook has four main sections. 
First, I’m going to briefly explain why most people’s ads hit a ceiling and how to scale past it.
Second, I’m going to explain the ad creation process I use. 
Third, I’ll explain the types of ads I use - which give you endless buckets of creative. 
Fourth, I’ll give you my most prized advertising possession - the ad kaleidoscope. 

Armed with the knowledge from all four sections, you’ll be able to create ‘banger after 
banger’ and pummel your competition. Let’s make some money.

Why Ads Hit A Wall And How To Scale Past It

In the beginning, you start with the smallest but highest converting eyeballs. Then, as 
you scale, you go to progressively larger but lower-converting eyeballs. Eugene Swartz has a 
wonderful framework around this. He contends that audiences go from bottom (warmest 
and smallest) to top (coldest and largest) in alignment with the image above:

1)	 Most Aware: (bottom) The customer knows your product and only needs to know 
the deal.

2)	 Product-Aware: The customer knows what you sell but isn’t sure it’s right for them.
3)	 Solution-Aware: The customer knows the result they want but doesn’t know your 

product can provide it.
4)	 Problem-Aware: The customer senses they have a problem but doesn’t know there’s 

a solution.
5)	 Completely Unaware: (top) The customer doesn’t know they have a problem or 

need.

GOATed Ads : Why Ads Hit A Wall And How To Scale Past It

I want to be clear, I’ve never met these people in Eugene’s pyramid. Labels are clean. 
Reality is messy. All I know is that the larger the audience I reach, the more varied and ex-
ceptional my ads must be. And for that reason I’ve adapted his chunked model into a con-
tinuous one. I find thinking about it like this to be more useful for actual business owners. 
I visualize it like this.

Ads start profitably, then depending on how good the creative is (how strong the hook, 
the offer, and the person delivering it), the colder the traffic it can convert. The higher up 
the pyramid it can scale. That being said, easier said than done. And this playbook isn’t 
about theory, it’s about doing. So, if we want to scale our ads, we want to make ads that con-
vert the highest percentage of the largest audience possible. And in my experience, we need 
to have a process that consistently creates bangers. Thankfully, we have just that.

T﻿he Ad Assembly Process

As I began to mass produce ads, I realized it was much harder to make a bunch of ads at 
once and much easier to make the ads in parts. So, over time I began ‘chunking’ ad creation 
into an assembly line like a process. First, I would make fifty hooks. Then, I would record 
the three to five very well-thought-out scripts to match the hooks, and then I would have 
my one to three versions of my Call To Action or CTA. 

As I began making ads this way, my ads began winning more often. And, I realized I 
wasn’t really creating ads at all. I was assembling them.

It only takes an hour or two to make the hooks, maybe an hour to record three to five 
‘meats’ and five minutes to record a few CTAs. The rest of the time is dedicated to prep. But, 
the result of this prep is 50 hooks x 3-5 meat x 1-3 CTAs = 150 to 750 ads…per week. This 
is how you scale advertising. It also gives you the side benefit of no one being able to fig-
ure out your top performing ads. So not only is this a good offense, it’s also a good defense 
against copycats.

So let’s dive into each chunk so you know what to do before your next recording session.

GOATed Ads : The Ad Assembly Process

Next Time You film

Six-Pack-Abs are made in the kitchen, not in the gym. And like six-packs, ads are made 
in research, not in recording. In other words, ninety percent of the work in advertising is in 
the preparation to record, not in the recording itself. Here’s how I split my prep time:

ʶ	 80% Hooks
ʶ	 20% Meat
ʶ	 ~0% CTAs
And this follows because if someone doesn’t make it through the hook, then nothing 

else matters. So we put eighty percent of our time there. 
I break up hook writing into two chunks. First, I write hooks off my previous winners. 

These are the bread-and-butter ads that you make on a weekly basis. Then, I write experi-
mental hooks to expand my ads into new markets. I explain both in detail below.

Writing Hooks For Immediate Results From Previous Winners

First, this isn’t my Best Hooks of All Time Playbook. In there, I go over the types of 
words to use, along with a list of my all time best hooks for content, emails, tweets, and paid

GOATed Ads : The Ad Assembly Process

ads.  Instead, this section focuses on how I find hooks to make high-converting advertise-
ments. I look for high-converting hooks in the following places:  
1)	 Winning Hooks From Your Previous Ads - These are literally past winners that I reuse. 

Over time you’ll develop a stable of winners you can use and reuse. You’d be amazed how 
much runway one good hook can give you. Note: If it’s your first time running ads, skip 
this one.

2)	 Winning Hooks From Your Free Content - One of my favorite things to do is find 
hooks that work on one platform or advertising method and use it in another. These 
have the highest likelihood of converting. I grab these from longs, shorts, tweets, emails, 
etc. That means I look at content that performed well, and see if I can chop the hook off 
the front and use it in an ad that may or may not be related to the content it came from 
originally.

3)	 Winning Hooks From Other People’s Ads - I save all ads I like and write down the 
hooks they use. If they are broad enough, and can be used as a hook for my ads, I use 
them. I have an album on my phone where I save them all.

4)	 Winning Hooks From Other People’s Free Content: You just look for content with 
tons of views in your space. Snag the hook and give it a shot. 

5)	 Platform-Specific Ad Libraries: I list this last because it’s the last place I look. Pros: You 
can see a bajillion ads from any business you want. Cons: You’ll have a hard time figuring 
out which ads perform well enough to justify modeling. Remember, most people don’t 
know what they’re doing. Big ad libraries become a fun place for ideas more than they 
guarantee winners. So if I’m looking for inspiration, I’ll look at companies I know run 
great paid ads, and see what hooks they are using. Key point: Winning hooks in one 
industry often work in others.
Once you get ads converting, it’s about doing more/better far more than about doing 

something new. But if you do need something new, especially to reach a broader audience, 
then you need to write expansion hooks. 

Writing Expansion Hooks To Enter New Markets

Let’s say you’ve ‘capped’ your existing ad capacity. You can’t spend anymore money prof-
itably. You likely need to refresh your creative. But let’s say you’ve done that too. If that’s the 
case, then you may need to expand the audience you target with your hooks.

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 7



GOATed Ads : The Ad Assembly Process

Here’s how: If you continue to write hooks that focus on your offer or proof, you will 
convert a small slice of a larger audience very well. To grab a bigger slice of the pie you’ll 
want to meet the audience where they’re at. Here are some example ad hooks that resonate for 
each level of awareness. 

1)	 Most Aware: These hooks are typically offer driven. 
a)	 “50% off our best-selling XYZ product for the rest of the month.”
b)	 Explanation: This hook targets customers who already know the business and its 

products/services. It focuses on a specific offer with a clear incentive. The goal is 
to get people on the fence to take action.

2)	 Product-Aware: These hooks are typically proof driven. 
a)	 “Discover why 10,000 people chose XYZ to solve their [problem] last month”
b)	 Explanation: This hook is for people who know about the product you sell but 

don’t yet know that you sell it.. It uses specific results and breadth of experience 
to build fast credibility and differentiate.

3)	 Solution-Aware: These ads are typically promise driven. 
a)	 “The fastest way to [achieve desired result] - introducing XYZ”
b)	 Explanation: This hook is for customers who are aware of the problem and know 

that solutions exist, but they may not know about your specific product or how 
it compares to others. They’re familiar with the general types of solutions avail-
able but haven’t decided on a particular one. At this level, you’d focus your mes-
saging on introducing solutions. You offer a specific, big outcome fast. You can 
also add specificity to the promise and timeframe to make it more compelling.

Copyright © 2025 by ACQUISITION.COM LLC NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION 8



GOATed Ads : The Ad Assembly Process

4)	 Problem-Aware: These ads are typically pain driven. 
a)	 “Tired of [specific problem]? There’s a better way”
b)	 Explanation: At this level, the potential customer knows they have a problem or 

need, but they’re not yet aware of the solutions available. They might be actively 
searching for ways to solve their issue, but they don’t know about specific prod-
ucts or services that could help them. 

5)	 Completely Unaware: These ads are typically curiosity driven. 
a)	 “The hidden danger in your daily routine that’s costing you [money/time/

health]”
b)	 Explanation: This hook targets people unaware they have a problem. It creates 

curiosity by suggesting there’s an unknown issue costing them. The goal is to make 
them curious and lead them down the road to becoming aware of their problem. 
This gets them thinking about solutions they didn’t know they needed until now.

Now that we have these templates, let’s translate them into business-to-business exam-
ples and business-to-consumer examples. Let’s start weight loss shake called XFast as our 
business-to-consumer example:

1)	 Most Aware: “XFast’s new formula: Now with 25% more protein - Same great taste!”
2)	 Product-Aware: “Why 9 out of 10 XFast users reached their goal weight within 3 

months”
3)	 Solution-Aware: “Lose 15 pounds in 30 days with our scientifically proven meal re-

placement system”
4)	 Problem-Aware: “Frustrated with crash diets that don’t last? There’s a sustainable way 

to shed pounds”
5)	 Completely Unaware: “The hidden hormonal imbalance that’s making 1 in 3 Ameri-

cans gain weight”

Let me walk you through a business-to-business example for a marketing agency called 
Digital Boost:

1)	 Most Aware: “DigitalBoost: Now offering social media management at 20% off for new 
clients”

2)	 Product-Aware: “See how DigitalBoost increased ROI by 150% for 5 different industries”
3)	 Solution-Aware: “Double your online sales in 6 months with our data-driven market-

ing strategies”
4)	 Problem-Aware:”Is your website getting sales? You might be missing these crucial 

elements”
5)	 Completely Unaware: “The unexpected way your business is losing $1000s each month 

in untapped revenue”

Pro Tip: The Widest Hooks Possible

Memes or meme-like content attract the largest percentage of your audience. 
If you target a narrower group than “everyone,” then they will have their own 
culture-specific memes you can advertise with in much the same way. A relevant 
meme for a specific audience works like a moth to a flame. It will explode the 
number of eyeballs exposed to your ad. Consider testing them. I certainly do. 

Hopefully, this is getting your wheels turning in terms of how you start your ads and 
make your content to appeal to more specific or broader audiences.

That being said, think of these more as frameworks than some magical recipe. You may 
see a national ad that has a killer offer-driven hook. Like the $5 Foot Long by Subway 
(which for 20 years ran as a sandwich ad). This only works because the entire nation knows 
the product. So in a way, they can have an offer driven hook - to everyone - because they’ve 
already spent hundreds of millions getting everyone to know who they are already. And, ev-
eryone knows what a sandwich is. So they have a known product, and a known brand. So 
they just need to make an offer. Whereas if you were a no name competitor, and you have 
a product that people need education to understand, leading with an offer driven hook to

a national audience would be the closest thing to burning money on fire. On the other ex-
treme, you might see a broad piece of content that spikes people’s curiosity and gets a very 
warm audience to buy. Like a movie trailer that converts a wide audience that also converts 
its warm audience of fans. So, this isn’t written in stone. This just gives you another set of 
tools in your arsenal when you’re writing down your 50 hooks. 

If 90% of your hooks land in the “Most aware” bucket, spread them out to capture a 
bigger slice. When in doubt, go a little broader. You still catch your warm audience and at-
tract some of the colder audience too.

I go through my own past winners. Then, I write fifty or so hooks spread across my au-
dience buckets. That’s about it. Then, I move into the next chunk of my prep document: 
the meat.

The Ad Meat

Every ad has creative. It’s the part of the ad that fulfills your hook. The creative aligns with 
the hook, the hook aligns with the audience’s awareness level. This means the creative tends 
to educate the customer about: the offer, the product, the solution, and the problem, or 
makes them aware about the phenomenon that is your product to begin with. 

As a reminder, the meat only takes twenty percent of my attention. The body of an ad gets 
rotated less often because fewer people see it. So you don’t ‘use it up’ as often. Usually three to 
five per weekly recording session is more than enough. 

When I looked back at all my ads, I used five major formats. No, I’m not saying these 
are the only formats. I’m just saying these are the ones I’ve used that worked. And they’ve 
worked across all industries: services, education, physical products, brick and mortar, soft-
ware, and so on. I also encourage their mixing and matching. Here they are:

1)	 Demonstration Ads
2)	 Testimonial ads
3)	 Education Ads
4)	 Story Ads
5)	 Faceless Ads

These are screenshots we ran on their own as ads.

Whenever I get stuck on what type of ad or format I’m going to use for the ‘meat’, I refer 
back to this list as an easy reference.

So, if you know your hook, and you have your meat, the last thing you need is your 
CTA. So let’s cover this quickly, then let’s get to the big secret…

CTA - Call To Action

Clear > Clever

If your ad got them interested, then your audience will have huge motivation… for a 
tiny time. Take advantage. Tell them exactly what to do next. S-P-E-L-L it out: Click this 
button. Call this number. Reply with “YES.” Go to this website. Scan this QR Code (wink). 
So many ads still don’t do this. Your audience can only know what to do if you tell them. 

If you want to take this up a level show and tell them. So not only do you make your 
CTA quick and easy…demonstrate what it would look like for them to follow the next step. 
Show what happens when they click the button. Show where they’ll need to fill out their 
information. Actually walk through the next steps and clicking submit on your site, or call 
your number. This seems obvious and basic, but almost no one does it…and it really works.

Now, when they click and get exactly what they expected, they’ll be more likely to follow 
through. It provides the ultimate congruence. 

Beyond these basics which most still forget, you can also use all the tactics like urgency, 
scarcity, guarantees, and bonuses. They get even more people to take action. So, they apply 
here, and everywhere else you tell your audience to do something.

Make One To Three CTAs Per Recording Session

CTAs come last. Mostly because they have to make sense for the ad, but they also take 
the least effort to make. But, they still play a critical role in a sound advertisement. If you 
don’t tell anyone to take action, you will have significantly fewer people taking action. In 
other words, more people will do what you want more often if you tell them to do it. 

So, once I know my offer, I only test a few CTAs. Once you have one that follows the 
fundamentals it will work well enough. A sound CTA’s hasn’t ever broken a campaign, but 
no CTA has. Here are a few ways you can tell your audience to take the next step. 

A good CTA shows or tells: what to do, how to do it, when to do it, what they get for 
doing it,  and what happens next. 

Example:
What to do: Take advantage of this great offer by
How to do it:  tapping the button on the bottom of your screen…
When to do it: ….before it expires…
What they get for doing it: …and you’ll get $1000 of free stuff.
What happens next* (optional): … delivered straight to your inbox.

*This is more important with lead magnets and multi-step sales processes*
Demonstration (video): Show what happens at each step visually.
Once I have one or two CTAs that work, I mostly stick with them. All you have to do 

to figure it out is run three identical hook + ad meat combinations, to the same audience, 
only changing the CTA.

For example, if I am telling people to start a 14-day free trial. I may run three different 
CTAs at the end of the same ad:

1)	 “Start free on the next page”
2)	 “Grab your 14-day free trial on the next page” 
3)	 “Get started on the next page free.”

 So I spend the least amount of time on CTAs. But once you have a clear one that fol-
lows the steps, stick with it.

GOATed Ads : CTA - Call To Action

Round Out Your CTA By Showing What Happens Next

I know all this stuff was easy to say, so let’s go through some examples.

1)	 Showing what happens next: Gym Launch Example
a)	 Full ad: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/VwC93Ln5db9qCoqj/ 

b)	 The CTA begins at 3:04 and shows what happens next.
c)	 Here’s a screenshot. 

Note: If I made this now I would show each screen on my digital board, then swiped through 
them live. But this ad still worked great.

2)	 Showing what happens next. Skool Example.
a)	 Full ad: https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?id=502288609151931

Next Up…

Now that you have the hooks, the meat, and the CTAs, you can put it all together. Let’s 
scale it.

Scale It

New customers enter your market everyday. And you owe it to them to serve them the 
highest converting ad possible to get them to buy so you can help them with whatever you 
do. So, don’t get bored repeating the same stuff. It’ll still be the first time they see it. 

In the beginning, you won’t know which ads are gonna hit. So, you gotta make a lot of 
variations. These variations appeal to many different segments of your market. Over time, 
you’ll find that a few ads wildly outperform the rest. And when you find those, double down 
on what works. Reuse the same hooks to make even more winners. They’re the key to unlock-
ing your customer’s wallet. This is what allows you to scale. 

Final Note

My ad creation process we went through in this playbook is how I find winners. Once 
you have winners, you’ll be ready for the next step: Kaleidoscope Ads. It’s how I take ads to 
the moon. But, you can’t do those without this. So, start here.

With that being said, let’s wrap our time together with a cheat sheet. That way, you can 
tear it out and put it on your wall or hand it to your team to use on your next ad day.

DO YOU WANT TO SCALE YOUR BUSINESS?

If you double your leads, you double your business. The easiest way to double 
the amount of leads you get is better advertising. And the easiest way to double 
advertising, is to make more, better ads. The only thing easier, is to make bad 
ads or no ads at all (most businesses). They’re the same people who wonder 
why they aren’t getting more customers, why costs keep going up, and why they 
can’t scale.

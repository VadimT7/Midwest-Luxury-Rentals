## 🔄 Automatic Revenue Share

Every booking payment automatically:

  on_behalf_of: merchant_stripe_account
  transfer_data: { destination: merchant_stripe_account }
  application_fee_amount: $70 (7% or 3% or 1% based on plan)
}
```

**Result**:
- Merchant receives: $930 (automatically to their Stripe account)

- Stripe pays out to merchant's bank in 2-7 days
